Districts of Innovation are able to gain local control of certain operations that are currently under the control of the Texas Education Agency. Goal 1: The Wharton ISD Board of Trustees and Wharton ISD Administration will make teacher certification decisions based on district qualifications that meet the unique needs of the district’s students and community. 1-1. Teacher Certification – General ● TEC §21.003 (b) CERTIFICATION REQUIRED ● TEC §21.053 PRESENTATION AND RECORDING OF CERTIFICATES ● TEC §21.057 PARENTAL NOTIFICATION (TEC §21.003a) (DK LEGAL) Manner in which statute inhibits the goals of the plan TEC §21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board of Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. TEC §21.053 (b) An educator who does not hold a valid certificate may not be paid for teaching or work done before the effective date of issuance of a valid certificate. TEC §21.057 requires that the District provide written notice to parents if an inappropriately or uncertified teacher is assigned to a classroom for more than 30 consecutive instructional days. Innovation Strategies Wharton ISD would like the ability to locally certify teachers in areas of high demand, to better meet the educational needs of our students. These areas would include, but are not limited to CTE; languages other than English; Science, Technology, and Math.

      "CISD District of Innovation Plan The Celina Independent School District is working through the process to become a District of Innovation. As outlined in Chapter 12 of the Texas Education Code, districts can become eligible for this distinction if certain performance requirements have been met and that the district follows specific procedures outlined in the statute. Over one hundred and twenty districts are either in the process or have approved their plans. Pursuing specific exemptions is left up to each individual school district, which allows more local control to areas that would benefit our students and families instead of a “one size fits all approach.” Districts selected for this distinction can ask for flexibility and/or exemption from certain sections of the Texas Education Code. Celina ISD has asked for flexibility in the following areas: 1. Teacher Certification Requirements 2. Uniform School Calendar 3. Probationary Contracts 4. Class Size Requirements for Elementary grades A Parent Meeting will be held on Thursday, January 26th, in the Celina Junior High School cafeteria starting at 6:00pm. CISD Assistant Superintendent Mr. John Mathews, will explain the importance of the District of Innovation Plan, and the four components specific to our plan. Those attending will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide input. A Public Hearing will be held on Monday, February 20th at the Celina Administration Building prior to the regularly scheduled CISD School Board Meeting. The hearing will begin promptly at 5:30pm.

      "District of Innovation APPROVED Humble ISD Board of Trustees August 9, 2016 Humble ISD District of Innovation Plan Introduction HB 1842 was passed during the 84th Texas Legislative Session in Spring 2015, and provides Texas public school districts the opportunity to be designated as Districts of Innovation. To access these flexibili- ties, a school district must adopt an innovation plan, as set forth in Texas Education Code Chapter 12A. Districts of Innovation may be exempted from a number of state statutes and will have: ✯ greater local control as the decision makers over the educational and instructional model for students; ✯ increased freedom and flexibility, with accountability, relative to state mandates that govern educational programming; and ✯ empowerment to innovate and think differently. Districts are not exempt from statutes including curriculum and graduation requirements, and academic and financial accountability. Our Process On June 21, 2016, the Humble Independent School District’s Board of Trustees passed a Resolution to Initiate the Process of Designation as a District of Innovation in order to support innovation and local initiatives to improve student learning. The Board also appointed a District of Innovation Committee on June 21 representing various stake- holders across the district, including teachers, parents, campus administration, and local business own- ers. The Committee met on June 30, 2016, to discuss and draft this Local Innovation Plan. Based on direction provided by the Board and input from various district stakeholders, the Committee proposes this Plan of Innovation. The District Decision Making Team, a body composed of representatives from all stakeholder groups within the district’s community, will meet on August 2, 2016. If a majority of their membership ap- proves the plan, it will go to the Board on August 9, 2016, for final approval. The Plan 1. Teacher Certification for Career and Technical Education Instructors Prior to 2013, students were expected to graduate under the “4x4” which required such courses as physics and Algebra II. With the adoption of House Bill 5 by the Texas Legislature in 2013, the state’s graduation requirements moved to a more personalized graduation plan that allowed students to earn endorsements in specific areas of study, including STEM, business and industry, public services, etc. Many of the career pathways that fall under the endorsements, such as health services or engineering, require very specialized certification in that particular field. Texas Education Code, sections 21.003, 21.053, 21.044 and 19 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 231, inhibit the development of post high school plans and improvement of work force skills to the extent these laws limit the District’s ability to hire teachers to teach hard-to-fill, high demand career and technical courses when quality certified teachers are not available. In order to enable more students to obtain the educational benefit of career and technical course offerings, the District seeks to establish its own local qualification requirements for such courses in lieu of the requirements set for in law while adhering to Texas Education Code 21.055(d.1). This exemption will afford the District the flexibility to hire professionals in certain trades and voca- tions to teach the crafts of those trades and vocations, such as welding, health sciences, architecture and construction, in career and technical courses.

      "Microsoft Word - GISD DOI PLAN - Final.docx GATESVILLE I.S.D. DISTRICT OF INNOVATION PLAN AS PRESENTED TO THE G.I.S.D. BOARD OF TRUSTEES House Bill 1842, passed in the 84th Texas Legislative Session, provides an opportunity for Texas public school districts to modify state requirements at the local level to better meet the needs of their unique student populations, in order to prepare them for success and lifelong learning. As a District of Innovation, Gatesville ISD will be able to implement the work of our GISD Portrait of a Graduate with the increased flexibility and freedom necessary to be innovative with the kinds of learning experiences afforded to our students. Making important educational decisions at the local level is the most effective way to support the innovation plans in our district. This plan is specific to the exemptions as outlined. The district intends to follow the Texas Education Code in all other areas. If at some point it is decided that changes or additional exemptions should be considered, as per the Districts of Innovation process, the district will reconvene the District of Education Advisory Committee to explore the request. Under HB 1842, districts may identify certain requirements imposed by the Texas Education Code (TEC) “that inhibit the goals of the plan and from which the district should be exempted on adoption of the plan. . .” The GISD Portrait of a Graduate demands innovative practices and opportunities for our students, and therefore, GISD seeks exemption from the following permissible provisions of the TEC as allowed in the statute: • Uniform Start Date • Minimum Minutes of Instruction • Class Size Ratio • 90 Percent Attendance • Teacher Certification Portrait of a Graduate In January of 2017, Gatesville I.S.D. adopted the Portrait of a Graduate to answer this question: What are the skills necessary for success for all children in this rapidly changing, increasingly diverse, and interconnected world? The Portrait of a Graduate moves Gatesville I.S.D. students and staff members to look beyond the high-stakes testing environment and to help our students develop skills so they can be successful in the workforce of the future. College or Career Ready ● Graduates of Gatesville I.S.D. will engage in a challenging curriculum, which will culminate in a preparation for a successful transition to college, career and workforce readiness. The classroom experiences for all students in Gatesville I.S.D. will match the student’s strengths and interests, as well as, challenges the mind, imagination, feelings and social skills. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills ● Graduates of Gatesville I.S.D. will continually seek to achieve quality results and outcomes through individual accountability, leadership, teamwork, and lifelong learning using multiple methods of technologies and resources. Moreover, Graduates of G.I.S.D. will engage in problem solving, inquiry, and design of innovative solutions to overcome obstacles to improve outcomes. Effective Communicator ● Graduates of Gatesville I.S.D. will comprehend and express ideas clearly through various means and modes of communication. Moreover, graduates of G.I.S.D. will demonstrate the belief that effective communicators can interpret and decode meaning through varied forms including: listening, reading, speaking, writing, interpreting and creating graphic images. Ethical Contributing Member of Society that Demonstrates Independence ● Graduates of Gatesville I.S.D. will experience the satisfaction of giving and serving others by living the principle of responsibility to community, which is learned through involvement in a cause or service. The student will acquire an appreciation to put others before self. Ultimately, the G.I.S.D. graduate will respond in love and service to those in need and strive to move beyond self-interest or self-centeredness in relationships with others.

      "WAELDER ISD: A DISTRICT PLAN FOR INNOVATION AND LOCAL CONTROL 2017-2022 APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ON IN ACCORDANCE WITH TEXAS HB 1842 WAELDER ISD District of Innovation Plan Summary Points: The 84th Texas Legislature passed House Bill 1842 in the spring of 2015, providing public school districts the opportunity to become Districts of Innovation. To qualify, an eligible school district must adopt a five-year innovation plan according to the Texas Education Code. Districts of Innovation may be exempt from state statutes to: • take greater local control in decision-making about the educational and instructional model for students; • have increased autonomy from state mandates that govern educational programming; and • be empowered to innovate and plan differently and creatively. Why is WAELDER ISD seeking the state’s official designation as a District of Innovation? • The WAELDER ISD Board of Trustees resolved in April 2017 to seek designation as a District of Innovation. • This plan supports exemplary practices and local decision-making processes to improve student learning. • The board appointed a District of Innovation Committee in April 2017 to represent teachers, parents, and administration. Under this plan, what might innovation look like in WAELDER ISD? • WAELDER ISD will achieve the flexibility to exercise more creative local control over existing quality programs without some statutory constraints. WAELDER ISD will use innovative strategies to provide increased opportunities for student and staff success. The proposed plan would: -Maintain reasonable class sizes in grades K-4. Except in unique and extenuating circumstances, WAELDER ISD will make every effort to begin each school year with enough teachers to preserve an important student-to-teacher ratio of 22:1 per K-4 homeroom class. - Determine a flexible school start date. WAELDER ISD will determine on an annual basis its own local starting date for the first semester, not to precede the second Monday in August of any given year, instead of the Texas statute that requires districts to begin a new school year on the fourth Monday of August. - Allow alternatives to educator certification. When a certified educator is not found for an offered course, the school district may allow a non-certified professional OR a certified educator to teach a subject in a related field without the traditional state credentials. -Adjust instructional minutes and school day length. WAELDER ISD will make every effort to meet the goal of 75,600 instructional minutes per year, but may want to approach this total more creatively without being confined to either 420 minutes or seven hours of instruction every day.

INTRODUCTION House Bill 1842, passed during the 84th Legislative Session, allows Texas public schools with sufficient academic ratings to obtain exemptions from certain provisions of the Texas Education Code. The allowable exemptions are for those sections of code that do not apply to charter or private schools in an attempt to reduce the extra administrative or operational burdens placed on public schools. To obtain exemptions, the District must create a Local Innovation Plan detailing the code requirements that inhibit the goals of the District and the benefits to the District expected from the exemption. II. TERM The term of the plan will begin with the 2017-2018 school year and terminate at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, unless amended, rescinded or renewed by the District of Innovation Committee and the Board of Trustees. The District of Innovation Committee will review the plan annually to confirm consistent alignment with the needs of the District.

Pettus ISD took the first step in exploring this opportunity when the PISD Board of Trustees approved a resolution initiating the process on March 27, 2017. The Board then held a public hearing to consider whether the district should develop an innovation plan, at which time the Board decided to move forward in the process. A committee was appointed to develop an innovation plan, and the plan was then created. The innovation plan was posted online on May 1, 2017 for at least 30 days. The committee approved the plan on June 6, 2017 during a public hearing. The Pettus ISD Board of Trustees approved the plan on June 6, 2017 during a special called meeting for 5 years. The term of the plan is from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2022. Innovations Pettus ISD, in conjunction with the District of Innovation Planning Committee, proposes the following flexibilities with the Texas Education Code to provide the best educational opportunities for students at PISD. 1.

II. Process On February 13, 2017, the Board appointed a District of Innovation Committee which was composed of administrators, teachers, parents, business owners, and community representatives. The committee met on February 16, 2017 to discuss options pertaining to the plan of Innovation and to determine which of these options might benefit Riesel ISD schools and community. After the development of the plan, it was posted for public viewing and comment for 30 days beginning on February 27, 2017 and the Commissioner of Education was notified at the Texas Education Agency. On March 28, 2017, the Local Innovation Committee voted to approve the final document and it was approved by the Riesel ISD Board of Trustees on April 11, 2017. III. Committee Members 1.

On April 25, 2016, the Grapevine Colleyville Independent School District passed a Resolution authorizing the district to pursue the District of Innovation designation in order to increase local control over district operations and to support innovation and local initiatives to improve educational outcomes for the benefit of students in the community. On May 23, 2016, the GCISD Board of Trustees held a Public Hearing to allow the public to learn more about the designation and provide feedback. The Board appointed a Local Innovation Committee comprised of community members, parents, teacher leaders, and campus and district level administrators to prepare a Local Innovation Plan to address the needs of the district. This Local Innovation Committee met over a three-month period to develop an initial draft of the Local Innovation Plan. The plan was posted online for public viewing and feedback on January 13, 2017, and remained online until February 27, 2107. The plan was presented to the GCISD District Excellent Committee (DEC) on February 2, 2017 and it was recommended by the DEC that the plan be presented to the Board for consideration. On February 27, 2017, the Local Innovation Committee presented the plan to the Board, where it was approved and adopted.

      "Monahans-Wickett-Pyote Independent School District DISTRICT OF INNOVATION INTRODUCTION House Bill 1842 was passed during the 84th Texas Legislative Session in the spring of 2015 and provides Texas public schools the opportunity to be designated as Districts of Innovation. This designation provides an opportunity for school districts to modify state requirements at the local level to better meet the needs of the students being served. To access these flexibilities, a school district must adopt a comprehensive innovation plan, as set forth in Chapter 12A of the Texas Education Code. Districts of Innovation may be exempt from state statues to:  take greater control in decision-making about the educational and instructional model for students;  have increased autonomy from state mandates that govern educational programming; and  be empowered to innovate and plan differently. PROCESS On February 20, 2017, the Monahans-Wickett-Pyote ISD’s Board of Trustees passed the “Resolution to Consider Designation as District of Innovation” in order to initiate the state-required process for gaining this designation within the District. A public hearing was held during the regular board meeting of March 20, 2017, in order to allow employees, parents, students and community members the opportunity to share opinions regarding the District’s pursuit of the District of Innovation designation. Additionally, at this meeting, the Board of Trustees approved the members of the District of Innovation Committee and charged the committee with the responsibility of developing a local innovation plan. The District of Innovation Committee met on March 23, 2017, to develop the local plan and on March 30, 2017, to finalize the plan. The Local Innovation Plan was presented as part of a public hearing at the regular meeting of the Board of Trustees on April 10, 2017. As required for District of Innovation designation, the local plan was posted on the District’s website for 30 days from April 11 – May 10, 2017, along with notification to the Commissioner of Education. Final approval of the Local Innovation Plan was made by the District Education Improvement Committee on May 22, 2017, and the Board of Trustees on June 19, 2017. TERM The MWP-ISD’s Local Innovation Plan will be in effect for five years beginning in August, 2017, and ending June, 2022, unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board in accordance with statue. If, within the term of this plan, other areas are to be considered for flexibility as part of HB 1842, proposed exemptions in the form of amendments will be presented to the DEIC and Board of Trustees for approval. Any amendments will adhere to the same term as the original plan. The District may not implement two separate plans at any given time.

This flexibility of the start date also offers the following opportunities:  Equalizes the number of instructional days between the first and second semesters of the school year.  Aligns start dates with local colleges and universities, which provide dual-credit opportunities for students.  Allows for a shortened week at the beginning of the school year to ease the transition for students entering kindergarten or transitioning from one grade-level campus to another.

      "DISTRICT OF INNOVATION PLAN January 2017 through December 31, 2021 Every student prepared for a successful future Introduction House Bill 1842, passed during the 84th Legislative Session, provides public school districts the opportunity to see designation as a District of Innovation to obtain exemption from certain provisions of the Texas Education Code. To access these flexibilities, a school district must adopt an innovation plan, as set forth in Texas Education Code Chapter 12A. Districts are not exempt from statures including curriculum and graduation requirements, and academic and financial accountability. Term The term of the Plan is five years, beginning with the 2017-2018 school year and concluding a the end of December 2021, unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the law. The DEIC (Innovation Committee) will continually monitor the effectiveness of the Plan and recommend to the Board and suggested modifications to the Plan. Timeline December 12, 2016 - Board of Trustees adopts resolution January 9, 2017 - Board of Trustees holds a public hearing to consider developing a plan for innovation January 9, 2017 – Board of Trustees appoints an Innovation Committee January 10 - 11, 2017 – Innovation Committee creates innovation plan January 12, 2017 – Draft plan is placed on the District website January 13 through February 10, 2017- District Innovation Plan discussed at campus meetings and DEIC public meeting on February 8, 2017.

This was the rule for many years; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. The Texas tourism groups lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting their tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. The current process allows no flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Proposed To best meet the needs of the students, school, and community, the District will have the flexibility to determine the school start date. The date can be prior to the 4th Monday of August as determined locally and on an annual basis. Teacher certification (TEC §21.003a) (DK LEGAL) Currently TEC §21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board of Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. Proposed The District seeks to establish it\n",

ACISD notifies the Commissioner of intent to approve plan and District of Innovation Plan posted on District website: http://www.acisd.org. ACISD Board of Trustees vote to approve innovation plan (2/3 majority vote required). This plan is specific to the exemptions as outlined. The district intends to follow the Texas Education Code in all other areas. If at some point it is decided that changes or additional exemptions should be considered, as per the Districts of Innovation process, the district will reconvene the District of Education Advisory Committee to explore the request. The term of the plan is for five years, beginning at the start of the 2017-2018 school year and ending at the end of the 2021-2022 school year. Under HB 1842, districts may identify certain requirements imposed by the Texas Education Code (TEC) \"that inhibit the goals of the plan and from which the district should be exempted on adoption of the plan . . . \" The ACISD Profile of a Learner demands innovative practices and opportunities for our students, and therefore, ACISD seeks exemption from the following permissible provisions of the TEC as allowed in the statute:  Uniform Start Date • Campus Behavior Coordinator Provisions  Minimum Minutes of Instruction • Teacher Certification  Class Size Ratio • Probationary Contracts  90 Percent Attendance Board Meeting: 01/19/17 Board Meeting: 01/19/17 DEIC Meeting: 03/06/17 Board Meeting: 03/09/17 Day after Board Meeting: 03/10/17 Board Meeting: 04/20/17 http://www.acisd.org/ 3 Uniform School Start Date (EB LEGAL) (Ed.

In the past, districts could apply for a waiver to start the school calendar earlier to meet the needs of the local community. This waiver opportunity was met with resistance from the Texas tourism groups who lobbied to have the practice ended, because they believed it was detrimental to the Texas tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. Proposed flexibility: This flexibility of start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. Flexibility\n",

      "Sabine ISD District of Innovation Plan 2017 - 2022 Introduction During the 84th Legislative Session, HB 1842 passed which allows Texas public schools to become Districts of Innovation which would allow them to obtain exemptions from certain provisions of the Texas Education Code. Sabine ISD is exercising this opportunity to gain more local control and will request the following exemptions from the Texas Education code. Term Sabine ISD’s Innovation Plan will implement the District of Innovation Plan in the 2017-2018 school year. The plan will renew at the end of the 2020-2021 school year unless the plan is terminated or amended by the Sabine ISD Board of Trustees in accordance with HB 1842. If at any time within this plan, other areas of exemptions are to be considered, the Sabine ISD Board of Trustees will nominate a new committee to consider new exemptions. Any future amendments will adhere to the same term of the original plan. Innovations 1. School Start Date (TEC 25.0811a) (EB LEGAL) Current Law TEC 25.0811 state that a school district may not begin student instruction before The 4th Monday of August. The current process allows no flexibility in the development and design of the annual school calendar to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the Sabine ISD Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Innovation Strategies Proposed 1. Sabine ISD students will begin instruction no earlier than the 3rd Monday of August. This change will create better flexibility in the development of the annual school calendar as well as allowing more opportunities in scheduling meaningful and balanced staff development days. 2. The earlier start date will allow Sabine ISD to move instructional days that occur after state mandated testing dates to the front of the school year. 3. The earlier start date will provide opportunity for an equitable balance of days for each of the three six week grading periods in the first semester. 2. Certification - General (TEC 21.003a) (DBA LEGAL) Current Law TEC 21.003(a) states a person may not be employed as a teacher, teacher intern or teacher trainee, librarian, educational aide, administrator, educational diagnostician, or school counselor by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued as provided by Subchapter B. Innovation Strategies Proposed 1. The campus principal may submit to the superintendent a request for local certification that will allow a certified teacher to teach outside of their certified field(s) in hard to fill areas. The principal must specify in writing the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses that would qualify this individual to teach the proposed subject. 2. The current certification requirement sets limitations for the district’s options to hire professionals with work related experience or degrees to teach a variety of courses from CTE and STEM related courses needed throughout the district. In order to maximize the opportunities for students to take such courses, the district will consider the qualifications necessary to create a local requirement for these courses instead of the requirements set forth in TEA 21.003(a). This exemption will allow the district to: A. Consider part time professionals to teach courses B. Opportunity for professionals to transition from other work related jobs to the teaching profession. C. Increase the number of CTE and STEM type courses available. D. Opportunities for trade related professionals to teach related courses. 3. The district will have the flexibility to recognize out of state certifications and extend the temporary one year certificate requirement. The campus principal may submit to the superintendent a request to allow certified out of state teachers to continue to teach a course or grade level beyond the one year state temporary certificate requirement. The superintendent will then approve the request if they feel\n",

      "BROWNSBORO INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT 2017 – 2018 DISTRICT OF INNOVATION PLAN District of Innovation A District of Innovation is a concept passed by the 84th Legislative Session in House Bill 1842 giving traditional independent school districts most of the flexibilities available to the state’s open enrollment charter schools. Any district with an academic performance rating of at least Academically Acceptable is eligible. The idea behind Districts of Innovation is that a local school district may want to pursue specific innovations in curriculum, instruction, governance, parent or community involvement, school calendar, budgeting, or other areas. An innovation plan allows a district to gain exemption from many Texas Education Code requirements, thus gaining more local control. Each innovation plan is expected to be unique to each school district, allowing for local values and goals to be incorporated into the plan. Brownsboro ISD took the first step in exploring this opportunity when the Board approved a resolution initiating the process in December. The Board then held a public hearing to consider whether the district should develop an innovation plan, at which time the Board decided to move forward in the process appointing a committee to develop an innovation plan. The plan then will be posted on-line for at least 30 days. Following the 30 days on-line, the District’s Plan of Innovation will go back to the Board for approval. Some areas where Districts of Innovation can gain flexibility are: school start date, minimum minutes of instruction, class size ratio, 90-percent attendance rule, teacher certification and contracts, teacher appraisal system and student discipline provision. Each district may identify different areas where their plans would take advantage of the flexibility that is available. Requirements that Districts of Innovation cannot be exempted from are: elected Boards of Trustees, PEIMS reporting, criminal history checks, curriculum and graduation requirements, bilingual education, special education, pre-K programs, academic accountability including student assessments, financial accountability, open meetings and public records rules, and purchasing regulations. The term of the Local Innovation Plan will begin at the start of the 2017-2018 school year and end with the 2021-2022 School Year, unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the law. The committee will revisit the plan annually to ensure that the recommendations are still in line with the needs and wishes of the district. Any changes recommended would be on the website for 30 days and require approval of the Innovation Committee and the School Board. District Innovation Committee Members 1.

      "FORNEY ISD DISTRICT OF INNOVATION PLAN Forney ISD is driven by Six Board Goals developed in conjunction with our parents, community, and stakeholders. These goals drive all decisions regarding teaching and learning in FISD. 1. Learning Organization: We will have a sound and efficient learning organization that supports learning and prepares for transition. 2. Learning Standards: We will implement research-based curriculum through relevant, engaging, and innovative instruction that meets the needs of all learners. 3. Learning Environment: We will create a diverse learning environment tailored to the needs of our students. 4. Assessment: We will continuously use formative and summative assessments for the students, educators, campuses, and district to encourage learning, mastery, and growth. 5. Digital Literacy: We will integrate technology that develops students to live, learn, earn, and play responsibly in a digital world. 6. Community Partnerships: We will develop parent and community partnerships that promote relationships that expand opportunities for students. In order to best serve our students and align our learning to the FISD board goals, we have developed a five-year District of Innovation Plan to provide opportunities that allow the FISD Board of Trustees the ability to use their best judgement to make decisions regarding the students of FISD. FISD is a community with diverse students and unique challenges. Giving the board local control of these decisions will provide lasting effects on our students, parents and community. I. First Day of Instruction - Board Goal 1 Learning Organization Exemption From: ​ TEC §25.0811, TEC §25.0812 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: TEC §25.0811 ​ states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. TEC §25.0812 ​ states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. Proposal : ​ These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. The flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable the district to develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in FISD. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days Forney ISD does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, disability, or age in its programs and activities. prior to mandatory testing, and a school end date prior to June. By ending earlier, FISD can support students who need remediation, as well as students who are entering college or trade school. An earlier school start date allows these students to register for summer classes and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time. II. Teacher Certification Requirements - Board Goal 2 Learning Standards Exemption From: ​TEC §21.003(a) TEC §21.053,TEC §21.057 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: TEC §21.003(a) ​ states that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board of Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. TEC §21.053 ​requires a teacher to present his or her certificate to the District before their employment contract will be binding, and prohibits the District from paying an educator for teacher if the educator does not hold a valid certificate at the time.

Code 25.0811 (a)) Current Statute: (a) Except as provided by this section, a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. Proposal: Junction ISD would like the flexibility to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community for the school start date. Flexibility to start earlier in August would help our district plan for balanced instructional time in the semesters that would support staff development days throughout the year. Minimum Minutes of Instruction (Ed. Code 25.081, 25.082 (a)) Current Statute: House Bill (HB) 2610, passed by the 84th Texas Legislature, amends the Texas Education Code (TEC) 25.081, by striking language requiring 180 days of instruction and replacing this language with language requiring districts and charter schools to provide at least 75,600 minutes of instruction (including intermissions and recess). The bill also allows school districts and charter schools to add minutes as necessary to compensate for minutes of instruction lost due to school closures caused by disaster, flood, extreme weather conditions, fuel curtailment, or another calamity. 25.082 (a) A school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses.

HB 1842 allows a traditional public school to utilize the exemptions in Education Law that charter schools currently are entitled to. We feel this is a great opportunity for our local district to create a plan based on the needs of our students and community that will remain in effect for the next five years (2017-2022).

Alicia Perez Parent 15. Shelly Johnson Parent 1. School Start Date (EB Legal) (Ed. Code 25.0811) Current Law Students are prohibited from starting school before the 4th Monday of August. For years, this was strictly a local decision. The Texas tourism groups lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting their tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. Proposed To develop a calendar that fits the needs of the community of Paradise. We have developed a calendar that we feel meets the students, community, and staff needs. a. Students will begin no earlier than the 2ndMonday of August. b. This start date will provide more educational days prior to state testing. c. This will allow the first and second semesters to be somewhat equal in the number of days of instruction. d. The goal is to improve the district attendance rate and student success through the flexibility in the calendar. 2. Teacher Certification (DK Legal, DK Local, DK Exhibit) (TEC.21.003) Current Law In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must submit a request to the Texas Education Agency. TEA then approves or denies this request. In certain circumstances, a district can use a local one-year permit. Proposed In order to best serve PISD students, decisions on certification will be handled locally. a. The campus principal may submit to the superintendent a request to allow a certified teacher to teach one subject out of their certified field. The principal must specify in writing the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses in which would qualify this individual to teach this subject. b. An individual with experience in a CTE field could be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course through a local teaching certificate. The principal will submit the request to the superintendent with all the individual’s credentials. The superintendent will then approve the request if they feel the individual could be an asset to students. The superintendent will then report this action to the Board of Trustees prior to the individual beginning any employment. Local teaching certificates will be for one year. The employee will be at-will. c. This proposal will provide more flexibility in our scheduling and more options for our students in class offerings. 3.

      "Bells Independent School District District of Innovation Plan ______________________________________________________________________________ TERM The term of the plan is for five year, beginning on February 20, 2017 and ending February 18, 2022, unless amended or rescinded by the BISD Board of Trustees in accordance with statute. If within the term of this plan additional innovations are to be considered, the Board of Trustees will appoint a committee and replicate the process used for initial adoption. Any additional exemptions that are approved will adhere to the same term as the original plan. PROPOSED INNOVATIONS 1. First Day of Instruction Current Provision: TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. Benefit of Exemption for BISD: *District aDvisory Committee will have the flexibility to start school one week early, the third Monday in August or a mid-week start during the third week of August. *Starting one week earlier will better balance the two semesters with a naural Winter Break, set exams prior to the Winter Breakd, and create more instructional time before STAAR/EOC exams. *The balanced semesters will align with college semesters as well, allowing more opportunities for summer school, internships, and certification opportunities. Local Guidelines: The district Improvement Committee will receive parent and staff input, then decide , subject to school Board approval, the school start date. 2. Teacher Certification Current Provision: TEC 21.003 requires that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a district unless the person holds an appropriate certification or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. Benefits of the Exemption for BISD: *The statutory certification requirements inhibit the District’s ability to hire professionals with industry experience to teach Career and Technical Education (CTE), STEM Courses and no-core electives. *Local qualifications will allow the district to: -allow experienced teachers to pick up an elective in an area they are qualified but not certified -hire community college instructiors Bells Independent School District -offer dual opportunities in dual enrollment CTE courses -recruit teachers from the field, including individuals from certain trades and/or vocations with industry knowledge and real world experiences. Local Guidelines: *The District will establish local criteria, such as years of experience, qualifications, and industry certification, to qualify for a local (district) teaching certificate. *Principals will submit candidates to the Superintendent with credentials. The Superintendent will determine whether it is in the best interest of the district to certify the individual. The Superintendent will notify the Board of Trustees prior to the candidate beginning assignment. *At the present time, BISD will focus on elective and courses, including CTE courses. However, in the future, the district may have a need to exercise this option in other courses. Our local Board would be able to issue the school district teaching permit for an individual teaching these courses based on qualifications certified by the Superintendent. *All candidates will be carefully considered to ensure the individual has sufficient education and expertise to provide instruction necessary to meet the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for the courses to be taught. *A clean criminal background check will be required of any candidate in compliance with the State Board of Education rules. In addition, the individual will be required to attain training and staff development to enhance his/her quality of instruction delivery. The individual will be employed on an at will basis with the district. 3.

      "District of Innovation Plan – Weatherford ISD WEATHERFORD INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT District of Innovation Plan District of Innovation Plan – Weatherford ISD Overview House Bill (HB) 1842, passed during the 84th Legislative Session, permits Texas public school districts to become Districts of Innovation and to obtain exemption from certain provisions of the Texas Education Code. On January 16, 2017, the Weatherford Independent School District’s Board of Trustees (“Board”) passed a Resolution to Adopt a District of Innovation Plan to increase local control over District operations and to support innovation and local initiatives. The adoption of this plan seeks to increase the District’s flexibility in order to improve educational outcomes for the benefit of students and the community. On February 14, 2017, the Board appointed a thirty-eight member District of Innovation District Advisory Committee (“Committee”) comprised of teachers, principals, parents, community members, and administrators. The Committee met on February 21, February 28, March 7 and March 21, 2017 to discuss and draft the Local Innovation Plan (“Plan”). Term The term of the Local Innovation Plan may not exceed 5 years. It will take effect at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year and end with the 2021-2022 school year, unless the plan is terminated or amended by the WISD Board of Trustees. An exception is the exemption of the Uniform School Start Date, which will not go into effect until the 2018-2019 school year.

      "BRAZOS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT District of Innovation Plan 2017/2018 thru 2021/2022 Approved by Brazos ISD School Board on 2/20/2017 Approved Amendments by Brazos ISD School Board on 8/30/2017 District of Innovation Committee: Special Programs: Teresa Ressler Principal: Mary McCarthy Principal: Lauren Almanza Principal: Clay Hudgins Counselor: Nanette Kubena Spec. Ed. Monica Gross Parent: Rachelle Demny Community: Carolyn Raska Teachers: Chad Divin Stephanie Snedaker Jill Hutchins Kimberly Vykukal Ray Hanzelka Karen McCain Patricia Banse Janice Hajek Holly O’Rourke Jessica Galan Pamela Hengst Introduction: A District of Innovation is a concept passed by the 84th Texas Legislature that gives traditional independent school districts most of the flexibilities available to open enrollment charter schools, including exemption from many requirements mandated in the Texas Education Code. To create a District of Innovation, a school district must adopt a five-year innovation plan according to the Texas Education Code. Exemptions: What areas of flexibility can BISD consider in its District of Innovation plan? A District of Innovation may adopt a plan that includes exemptions from most of the same state laws that are not applicable to open enrollment school districts. These laws could include:  Uniform school start date  Class size ratio  Minimum minutes of instruction  The 90 percent attendance rule (but compulsory attendance still applies)  Student discipline provisions (with some key exceptions, like the requirement to have a code of conduct and restrictions on restraint and seclusion)  Teacher appraisal system  Teacher certification (except as required by federal law)  Teacher contracts  Teacher benefits  Site-based decision making processes (to the extent required by state law) Brazos ISD is not seeking exemptions from all areas as they do not fit the needs of our district. Time Frame: November 14, 2016: DEIC Committee met and discussed district of innovation process. November 21, 2016: School Board took action to approve a resolution to initiate the process of Brazos ISD becoming a District of Innovation. December 14, 2016: Board approved the District of Innovation Committee January 3, 2017: Superintendent and Special Programs Coordinator met with all 4 campuses to discuss and evaluate the plan with the faculty. January 9, 2017: DEIC edited and approved proposed plan January 11, 2017: Plan posted on district website. January 16, 2017: Board took action to send Commissioner of Education letter of intent February 20, 2017: Board approved final plan August 10, 2017: DOI Committee Meeting to discuss proposed amendments August 14, 2017: voted to approve changes August 30, 2017: Changes approved by the board Proposed Exemptions: DETERMINE A FLEXIBLE SCHOOL START DATE (TEC §25.0811a) (EB LEGAL) Manner in which the statute inhibits the plan: The Texas Education Code states a school district may not begin student instruction before the fourth Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to begin earlier, even as early as the second Monday in August. The start-date waiver was eventually removed when the legislature determined school districts should begin the first semester no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. The current process allows no flexibility in the design and balancing of instructional semesters to meet the needs of students or the wishes of the local board of trustees, who represent community interests in this matter. The flexibility of school start date allows the district to determine, locally on an annual basis, a school calendar that will best meet the needs of our students and local community. The flexible start date allows us as a school district to balance the amount of instructional days in each semester. Additionally having this flexibility allows for a shortened start of school week, flexible staff development pla\n",
