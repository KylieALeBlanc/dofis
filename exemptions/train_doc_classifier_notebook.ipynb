Being a District of Innovation gives more local control, flexibility, and customization to better serve the needs of the local students. Graford ISD District of Innovation Plan START DATE/END DATE Current Law: TEC 25.0811 – A school district may not begin instruction for students before the 4th Monday of August. TEC 25.0812 – A school district may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15 GISD Plan: Having the flexibility to start prior to the 4th Monday in August will allow for a more balanced semester calendar, allow for school to be completed prior to Memorial Day, allows for more instruction time prior to the State Assessments given toward the end of the year. With the required 75,600 minutes of instruction requirement, GISD may be able to finish the school year prior to May 15. LENGTH OF SCHOOL DAY Current Law: TEC 25.081 – For each school year each school district must operate so that the district provides for at least 75,600 minutes. A school day consists of 420 minutes of instruction. GISD Plan: Graford ISD plans to occasionally, throughout the school year, have school less than 420 minutes per day. Shortening the school day will allow the flexibility to provide accelerated instruction, staff development, and a number of possibilities to best serve the students of Graford ISD. TEACHER CERTIFICATION Current Law: TEC 21.003 - A person may not be employed as a teacher, teacher intern or teacher trainee, librarian, educational aide, administrator, educational diagnostician, or school counselor by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate. GISD Plan: In order to best serve the students of Graford ISD, decisions on certification will be handled locally. a. An individual with experience in a CTE field could be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course through a local teaching certificate. The principal will submit the request to the superintendent with all the individual’s credentials. The superintendent will then approve the request if they feel the individual could be an asset to students. The superintendent will then report this action to the Board of Trustees prior to the individual beginning any employment. The employee will be at-will. b. This plan will allow more flexibility in our scheduling, allow for filling hard to fill positions, and will provide more options for our students in class offerings. PROBATIONARY CONTRACT Current Law: TEC 21.202 a person who is employed as a teacher by a school district for the first time, or who has not been employed by the district for two consecutive school years subsequent to August 28, 1967, shall be employed under a probationary contract. A person who previously was employed as a teacher by a district and, after at least a two-year lapse in district employment returns to district employment, may be employed under a probationary contract. GISD Plan: The district will have the right to extend the continuation of probationary contract status for teachers with 5 or more years of experience and are new to the District, at the discretion of administration, if it is in the best interest of the district. DESIGNATION OF CAMPUS BEHAVIOR COORDINATOR Current Law: TEC 37.0012. A person at each campus must be designated to serve as the campus behavior coordinator. The person designated may be the principal of the campus or any other campus administrator selected by the principal. GISD Plan: Due to the size of Graford ISD, the district is waiving the requirement of designating a Campus Behavior Coordinator. The discipline decisions of students is made by the Campus Principal when appropriate, otherwise the discipline decision is made by the appropriate administrator/designee. CLASS SIZE Current Law: TEC 25.112. A school district may not enroll more than 22 students in a kindergarten, first, second, third, or fourth grade class. GISD Plan: At the discretion of Administration, Graford ISD may enroll more than 22 students in a class in grades Kindergarten, First, Second, Third or Fourth grade, as appropriate. TEACHER CONTRACTS Current Law: TEC 21.401 (b.) An educator employed under a 10-month contract must provide a minimum of 187 days of service. GISD Plan: Teacher contracts days will be reduced from 187 to 182 with no effect on teacher salaries. This stems from an attempt to align the teacher days to the 75,600 minutes required of students. \\uf0b7 This plan will increase the daily rate the district pays teachers \\uf0b7 This plan will provide teachers more opportunities during the year to seek out beneficial staff development that relates to their field \\uf0b7 This plan should enhance teacher recruitment'"

       "\"Cherokee Independent School District District of Innovation Plan Introduction In order to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to Independent School Districts by HB 1842, Cherokee ISD is seeking to modify Education Code requirements at the local level in order to better meet the needs of our student population. Cherokee ISD is eligible for designation as an innovation district because the district's most recent performance rating under the Texas Education Code (TEC), §39.054, is at least Academically Acceptable, as indicated in the applicable year's academic accountability manual adopted under TEC §97.1001. Cherokee ISD is seeking to become a District of Innovation in order to facilitate areas of concern created by traditional public school restrictions imposed by the legislature through various laws enacted. Those areas specifically addressed in this plan are Teacher Certification requirements, Probationary Contracts, Teacher and Principal Appraisals and the First Day of Instruction. District of Innovation Committee Eldon Franco, Superintendent Randy Gartman, Principal Jennifer Bordner, Dean of Students Vickie Baugh, Business Representative Tiffany Berrio, 504/Inclusion Teacher Stephanie Bond, 6-8 Math Teacher Colt Broyles, Community Representative Kallie Bush, 3-5 Mathematics Teacher Chera O’Neil, Special Education Teacher Susan Shannon, 2nd Grade Teacher Valerie Valdez, Parent Representative Timeline Timeframe Activity Date Implemented October 2016 – February 2017 Community and Staff Involvement in exploring benefits of plan and seeking designation January 2017 – February 2017 March 2017 Presentation to Board and Resolution March 20, 2017 March – April 2017 Posting of Plan in the following areas: Post Office, Three Local Town Meeting Areas and the Administration Building* Plan sent to the Commissioner of Education Minimum of 30 days from March 20, 2017 April 2017 Public Hearing with District of Innovation Committee April 24, 2017 May 2017 Board of Trustees Plan Approval May 8, 2017 June 2017 Implementation/Length of Plan Implementation will be for a maximum of 5 years The District of Innovation Plan Certifications Required (DK(LEGAL), DK(LOCAL), DK(EXHIBIT); TEC 21.003, 21.055) Currently State law requires teachers to hold appropriate certifications by the appropriate state agency in order for a district to employ them. In the likelihood that a district is unable to locate a person with the appropriate certifications, a certified person may teach a subject outside of his or her certification only if the district requests an emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or the State Board of Educator Certification. Rationale for Exemption The current system makes it difficult to hire teachers for high needs core content areas as well as elective content areas. This system does not take into account the unique instructional, financial or community needs of our rural school district. Cherokee employs 20 educators who teach multiple areas within each day. In order for Cherokee to offer additional courses and be flexible in scheduling the district must have the ability to establish local qualification requirements. This would enable the district to employ community members, or current employees, who have working knowledge with limited certification(s). This flexibility would allow the district to hire professionals in areas of vocations, trades and languages. This would also enable the district to expand the CTE program by hiring professional tradesmen in areas such as welding, health science and criminal justice. Innovation Strategies \\uf0b7 The process begins with the principal. The principal will interview the already certified teaching candidate and request all necessary credentials from the candidate as they relate to position. This will only be to allow the candidate to teach one subject outside of candidate’s teaching certifications. Once the information is gathered the principal will begin the following process: o The reason for the request and credentials supporting qualification of the candidate to the superintendent o The superintendent will then evaluate the information presented and choose whether or not to take it to the Board for approval o The recommendation will be presented to the Board at the first meeting after the principal makes the request \\uf0b7 Individuals with trade experience, being considered for a CTE position, would be eligible to teach vocational skills through local district certification. The same process as above will be followed with the exceptions below. o The prospective employee would be considered at-will and not fall under a standard teaching contract o The Board would be notified, but not required to approve since the employee will be considered at-will \\uf0b7 Individuals with a college degree or certification in an elective or CTE area would be eligible to teach in his or her area of expertise through local district certification. The same process as above would be followed with the exceptions below. o The prospective employee would be considered at-will and not fall under a standard teaching contract o The Board will be notified, but not required to approve since the employee will be considered at-will Probationary Contracts (DCA(LEGAL); TEC 21.102) Currently State laws allows for those that are new to the profession be provided a probationary contract not to exceed three (3) years, and a new teacher who has taught five (5) of the last eight (8) may be offered a probationary contract not to exceed one (1) year. Rationale for Exemption The time period to evaluate a teacher’s effectiveness in the classroom is not long enough given the constraints put on the district by contract renewal guidelines, state assessment results and end of year progress testing. Innovation Strategies Experienced teachers that meet the current guidelines for a one (1) year probationary contract would be issued a probationary contract for no more than two (2) years. This will provide the administrative staff to more effectively evaluate the teacher’s performance. Appraisal on Basis of Classroom Teaching Experience Appraisal and Professional Development System for Principals (DNA(LEGAL), DNA(LOCAL); TEC §21.203, §21.352, §21.354, §21.3541) Currently The state requires that the Texas Teacher Evaluation and Support System (T-TESS) and the Texas Principal Evaluation and Support System (T-PESS) be used in appraising staff. These systems require that state standardized test scores be used as one of the main evaluation measures for teachers and administrators. Rationale for Exemption Cherokee ISD is developing an evaluation instrument for teachers, administrators and para- professional staff that will be used throughout the year. This instrument will be applicable to the programs offered by the district and address grade-level readiness, college readiness and implementation of the goals established by the district. For the district to promote professional development that focuses on individual growth the district will maintain it current practice of using a variety of measures, including observations, goal setting and tracking, student growth and progress toward established learning objectives and personal growth plans, as evaluation criteria on teacher and administrator appraisals. Innovation Strategy All staff members will be placed on a personal growth plan developed through collaboration that specifically provides measurable objectives, which are aligned with curriculum and district goals. These plans would be unique to the district and each staff member. First Day of Instruction (EB(LEGAL); TEC 25.0811) Currently State law requires that school districts may not begin school instruction prior to the fourth Monday in August. Rationale for Exemption The current start time does not allow for the district to implement many research based scheduling techniques that will provide for flexibility to increase student learning and success, promote staff development and collaboration, provide opportunities to for college and career readiness and balance the semesters for instructional and remediation times. Innovation Strategy Cherokee ISD would develop a calendar that begins no earlier than the 3rd Monday in August and require staff to return to duty no earlier than the 1st Monday in August. This would provide the following opportunities for the district. \\uf0b7 More instructional days in the school year and better balance the semesters \\uf0b7 More opportunities for staff development during the school year for professional growth, collaboration and student growth analysis \\uf0b7 Allow time for students and staff to recover over the course of the year by flexible scheduling opportunities\""
