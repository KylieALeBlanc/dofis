       "      <td>LTISD Plan of Innovation LAKE TRAVIS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT -Effective Dec. 13, 2016 – Dec. 13, 2021 Frequently Asked Questions Nhat is a District of Innovation? Nhat are the benefits to Lake Travis ISD becoming a District of Innovation? Nhat are the proposed areas of innovation for Lake Travis ISD? Nhat areas is Lake Travis ISD prohibited from seeking exemption? What is a District of Innovation? The District of Innovation concept was passed by the 84th Legislative Session in House Bill 1842 and has been codified in the Texas Education Code Chapter 12a. A District of Innovation designation gives traditional school districts most of the flexibility currently available to Texas’ open-enrollment charter schools. It gives a district more local control and increases a district’s ability to decide what best suits the district’s needs. Under HB 1842, districts may identify certain requirements imposed by the Texas Education Code “that inhibit the goals of the plan and from which the district should exempt on adoption of the plan.” What are the benefits to Lake Travis ISD becoming a District of Innovation? A District of Innovation will have the flexibility to implement practices similar to charter schools and exercise local control over certain decisions about education and governance that are more appropriate for the individual needs of the District. A District of Innovation is given empowerment to innovate and think differently based on the unique needs of the school, students, and staff. Becoming a District of Innovation allows a district to customize appropriate plans district-wide, a grade level, or a single campus. What are the proposed areas of innovation for Lake Travis ISD? First day of instruction Class size in grades K-4 Teacher Appraisal System Teacher Certifications Probationary Teacher Contracts What areas is Lake Travis ISD prohibited from seeking exemption? A District of Innovation cannot seek exemption from state or federal requirements applicable to an open enrollment charter school; state requirements for curriculum or graduation; and academic and financial accountability. Additionally, a District of Innovation cannot be exempt from statutes, including but not limited to, election of board of trustees; powers and duties of school boards, superintendents, and principals; criminal history record checks and educator misconduct reporting; bilingual education; special 2 Nhat is the process for developing and approving LTISD's Innovation Plan? ~ow long is the District of Innovation Plan effective? education; prekindergarten; academic accountability including student assessment; open meetings, open records; financial accountability and related reporting; and nepotism. What is the process for developing and approving LTISD’s Innovation Plan? On September 20, 2016, the Lake Travis ISD’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution to initiate the process of considering the designation of LTISD as a District of Innovation. The Board of Trustees appointed an innovation plan committee to explore and develop a local innovation plan. The innovation plan committee is comprised of key district stakeholders including, senior leadership, administration, staff, parents, board members, and community members. The innovation plan committee met in September, October, and November to draft, review, and prepare a final proposed Innovation Plan. The final proposed Innovation Plan will be posted on the District’s website for at least 30 days and can be accessed from the homepage at http://www.ltisdschools.org/. The District’s Advisory Committee for Education (ACE), established pursuant to Texas Education Code §11.251, will hold a public meeting on December 13, 2016 to consider and vote on the final version of the proposed plan. If the final proposed innovation plan is approved by a majority of the District’s ACE, the Board of Trustees will vote on whether to adopt the final proposed plan during the December 13, 2016 board meeting. If two-thirds of the membership of the board vote to adopt the plan, the District will be designated as a District of Innovation under Chapter 12a of the Texas Education Code and will begin operation in accordance with the plan. How long is the District of Innovation Plan effective? The plan will be in effect for a term of five years from the date of adoption (December 13, 2016 – December 13, 2021). The District of Innovation Plan may be amended, rescinded, or renewed only by a majority vote of the Innovation Plan Committee and the board of trustees in the same manner required for initial adoption. 3 http://www.ltisdschools.org/ Tlmellne Action Resoonsib11itv Date Action Responsibility Date Consideration of a designation by adoption of a resolution Board 9/20/16 Vote to adopt a resolution to consider designation Board 9/20/16 Hold a public hearing Board 9/20/16 Appoint a committee to develop a local innovation plan Board 9/20/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 9/22/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 10/6/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 11/2/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 11/10/16 Post proposed local innovation plan on website District 11/11 – 12/12/16 Send notification to Commissioner of intention to vote on local innovation plan Board 11/11/16 First reading for local innovation plan Board 11/15/16 ACE public meeting to consider final version of the proposed plan; ACE to vote on final plan Committee 12/13/16 Board to vote on approval of final plan Board 12/13/16 Notification to Commissioner of approval of plan District 12/14/16 4 tim) i-, Q1&gt;1 ~ E Q1&gt;1 ~ Q1&gt;1 Q1&gt;1 ~ ;, ·r-r iliiiiiiil E E Q) u c m ~ c Q) iliiiiiiil ~ ;, m &gt; Q) c c As hl ey G al le nk am p St ep ha ni e W ill ia m s De b Do lm an et Al ic ia M ar tin ez -D ur an El oi sa C er ni ck y De ni se H am ilt on Co lle en S er fo ss Ci nd y Al le n Ca ra C oo pe r Va ne ss a M al on e La ur en C ha m be rs Co ur tn ey T rim m er Jil l B ry an t M ar y N as ci m be ni Ka re n Fr ey Ke lly F re ed Pe rr is Ya te s M in dy P la nt e Ad el iza T iff an y Ka tie T ho m ps on Sh an no n Vo ge s M ic ha el B er ry Be at riz L op ez Ke vi n M al an dr uc co lo He at he r W rig ht Sh ar on S m ith Je nn y So ne s Go rd on B ut le r Da rn el l H or to n Am be r F or ge y Ja ni ce B ec h Ka th le en H as se nf ra tz Sa lli e In gl e Jo di e Vi lle m ai re Ka th y Bu rb an k Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Co un se lo r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pr in ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Co m m un ity * Te ac he r* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pr in ci pa l* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* C&amp; I* Bu sin es s/ Co m m un ity * Pr in ci pa l* C&amp; I* 5 Mary Patin Administration* Chief Todd Radford Business/Community* Holly Morris-Kuentz Administration Amber King Administration Marco Alvarado Administration Johnny Hill Administration Chris Woehl C&amp;I Liz Sims C&amp;I Rachel Benke C&amp;I Brandy Belk Athletics Charles Aguillon Fine Arts Angela Frankhouser Principal Sam Hicks Principal April Glenn Principal Amanda Prehn Principal Alex Alexander Board Member Ex-Officio Lisa Johnson Board President Ex-Officio *Current Advisory Committee on Education Members 6 Innovation Plan As a District of Innovation, Lake Travis ISD seeks to maximize local control over educational and governance decisions for students and staff. To carry forward that mission, LTISD seeks exemption from the following provisions of the Texas Education Code. The District intends to continue to follow the Texas Education Code in all other areas. If amendments to this plan are considered at some point in the future, the District will reconvene the innovation plan committee to initiate the appropriate process, as outlined in Chapter 12a of the Texas Education Code. FIRST DAY OF INSTRUCTION (Texas Education Code § 25.0811) (EB LEGAL, EB LOCAL) Manner in which the statute inhibits the plan The Texas Education Code requires that students may not begin school before the fourth Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to begin school earlier. The waiver process was eliminated several years ago, mandating that all schools begin school no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. This requirement inhibits the District’s flexibility to develop a calendar that best meets students’, staff’s, board of trustees’, and community members’ needs and desires. It also inhibits the District from creating a calendar that better balances the instructional semesters. Category of innovation Modifications to the school year Innovation strategies 1. To allow for a calendar that fits the local needs of our community, the District will determine on an annual basis the local starting date for the first semester of each school year. 2. Students will begin no earlier than the second Monday in August of any given year. These strategies provide the District the benefits of additional time for staff to plan and students to learn; additional time for staff to prepare for summer school; equitable allocation of the days in the two semesters; additional professional learning community time for staff; flexibility to end the school year earlier, which in turn, allows staff and 7 http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.25.htm http://pol.tasb.org/Policy/Search/1154?filter=EB%20local students starting college the ability to access the first summer semester of college courses. CLASS SIZE IN GRADES K-4 (Texas Education Code §§ 25.112, 25.113) (BF LEGAL, EEB LEGAL) Manner in which the statute inhibits the plan The Texas Education Code currently requires the District to maintain a class size of 22 students or less in each kindergarten through fourth grade class.

       "      <td>Zephyr ISD District of Innovation Plan Introduction HB 1842 was passed during the 84th Texas Legislative Session in Spring 2015, and provides Texas public school districts the opportunity to be designated as Districts of Innovation. To access these flexibilities, a school district must adopt an innovation plan, as set forth in the Texas Education Code Chapter 12A. Districts of Innovation may be exempted from a number of state statutes and will have: · Greater local control as the decision makers over the educational and instructional model for students; · Increased freedom and flexibility, with accountability, relative to state mandates that govern educational programming; and · Empowerment to innovate and think differently. Districts are not exempt from statutes including curriculum and graduation requirements, and academic and financial accountability. Process On February 19th, 2018 the Zephyr Independent School District’s Board of Trustees passed a Resolution to Initiate the Process of Designation as a District of Innovation in order to support innovation and local initiatives to improve student learning. On February 19th, 2018 the Zephyr ISD Board of Trustees held a public hearing on whether the District should pursue the designation as a District of Innovation. The Board of Trustees acknowledged the District of Innovation Committee plans to discuss and draft this Local Innovation Plan. This committee represents various stakeholders across the district, including teachers, parents, campus administration, district administration, and Board of Trustees. The committee met on March 1st and 8th to discuss and develop the plan. The plan was posted on the district website March 9th, 2018. The District Site-Base Decision Making Committee, a body composed of representatives from all stakeholder groups within the district’s community, met on March 20th, 2018. If a majority of their membership approves the plan, it will go to the Board on April 16th, 2018. Term The District of Innovation Plan will become effective in September 2018 and will remain in effect for five years, through June 2023, unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the law. Any amendment to the Innovation Plan must follow the same process as the plan development. The District of Innovation Committee would consider any proposed amendment/s. Any amendment/s would require majority approval of the District of Innovation Committee, a majority approval of the District Site-Based Committee, and posting on the district website for 30 days. A 2/3 vote by the Board of Trustees would be required for final approval of any amendment/s. Zephyr I.S.D.

FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL (EB LEGAL) (Texas Education Code 25.0811) Current Law 25.0811 – (a) A school district may not begin instruction before the 4th Monday in August, unless the school operates year-round, or is the district has more than 190,000 students: the days are financed by local funds, or the campus is under comprehensive reform, or the majority of the students at the campus(es) are educationally disadvantaged. Proposed This flexibility of a start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. This flexibility of the start date also offers the following opportunities: a) This will allow the first and second semesters to be somewhat equal in the number of days of instruction. b) Students participating in Dual Enrollment opportunities will work with balanced semesters, which align with our local colleges. c) An early start date permits students an additional week of instruction prior to state assessments in December. d) Students will be afforded opportunities to enroll in summer college sessions with finalized official transcripts and staff will be able to attend summer school classes as well. e) This would allow an option to start school with a shorter week, easing the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. ZISD Local Guidelines The district will determine, on an annual basis, when each school year will begin. TEACHER CERTIFICATION (DK LEGAL, LOCAL) (Texas Education Code 21.003) Current Law In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must submit a request to the Texas Education Agency. TEA then approves or denies this request. In certain circumstances, a district can use a local one-year permit. Contracted staff is required to work 187 school days. Proposed In order to best serve Zephyr ISD students, decisions on certification will be handled locally. With the current teacher shortage, this exemption from teacher certification requirements will enable greater flexibility in staffing and will enrich applicant pools in specific areas of need. The district’s exemption from TEC 21.003 would allow the district to consider part-time professionals to teach courses, allow industry expert professionals to transition into the teaching profession in Career and Technology and also assist in staffing high need STEM and dual credit course offerings. Out-of-state certified teachers could be considered for positions upon a local review of experience, education and credentials. Often there are experienced certified teachers in our district that could teach a course outside of their certification area due to their education, background and/or experience. Local decisions outside of state certification requirements would allow innovation and flexibility in scheduling to meet student needs. This proposal will provide more flexibility in our scheduling and more options for our students in class offerings as well as providing condensed professional development for individual teacher learning. Local Guidelines a) The campus principal shall submit to the superintendent a request to allow a certified teacher to teach a subject and/or grade level out of their field. The principal must specify the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses qualifying this individual to teach the subject. b) An individual with experience in a Career and Technology field may be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course. An individual may hold a teaching certification in another state for core areas or Career and Technology. An individual may have background, experience, skills or work related/ industry experience to work full time or part-time in a designated area. The principal shall submit a request to the superintendent for local certification. The principal must specify the reason for the request and document what credentials the individual possesses qualifying this individual to teach the subject. c) The superintendent will approve or deny requests for local certification. INTER-DISTRICT TRANSFERS (FDA LOCAL) (Texas Education Code 25.036) Current Law Currently, under Texas Education Code 25.036, a district may choose to accept, as transfers, students who are not entitled to enroll in the district, but TEC 25.036, has been interpreted to require a transfer to be for a period of one school year. Proposed Zephyr ISD maintains a transfer policy under FDA (Local) requiring nonresident students wishing to transfer to file a transfer application each school year. In approving transfer requests, the availability of space and instructional staff, availability of programs and services, the student’s disciplinary history records, work habits, and attendance records are also evaluated. Transfer students are expected to follow the attendance requirements, rules, and regulations of the district. TEC 25.036 has been interpreted to establish the acceptance of a transfer as a one-year commitment by the district. The district is seeking to eliminate the provision of a one-year commitment in accepting transfer applicants. On rare occasions, student behavior warrants suspension (in or out of school), placement in a disciplinary alternative program, or expulsion. In addition, student attendance may fall below the TEA truancy standard. In these rare cases, Zephyr ISD seeks exemption from the one year transfer commitment. Local Guidelines Nonresident students who have been accepted as a district transfer student may have such transfer status revoked by the Superintendent at any time during the year if the student is assigned discipline consequences of suspension (in or out of ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Zavalla ISD District of Innovation Plan (HB 1842) 2016-2017 Zavalla ISD is using HB 1842, of the 84th Legislative Session, to establish more local control in certain areas. HB 1842 allows a traditional public school to have some of the same local flexibility that public charter schools have been allowed. Zavalla ISD believes this is a great opportunity for our local district to establish plans based on the unique needs of our students and community. This plan will be in effect for the 2017-2018 school year through the 2021-2022 school year. This plan may be amended at any time by the committee with approval of the Board of Trustees.

Submitting waivers for Kindergarten – Grade 4 class size (EEB LEGAL) (Ed. Code 25.112, 25.113) Currently Kindergarten – 4th Grade classes are to be kept at a 22 student to 1 teacher ratio according to state law. When a class exceeds this limit, the district must complete a waiver with the Texas Education Agency. These waivers are never rejected by TEA. This is a bureaucratic step that serves no purpose. Along with the waiver, it is required that a letter is sent home to each parent in the section that exceeds the 22:1 ratio, informing them the waiver has been submitted. Many times soon after the waiver is submitted, students move out of the district and we are below the 22:1 ratio. Proposed While we certainly believe that small class size plays a positive role in the classroom, we do not believe it has a negative effect when you only add one or two more students. Many times it is not the number of the students but the makeup and chemistry of the classroom which influence the learning environment. a. ZISD will attempt to keep all K-4th core classrooms to a 22:1 ratio. However, in the event the class size exceeds this ratio, the superintendent will report to the Board of Trustees. b. In the event a K-4th core classroom reaches 24:1, the campus will notify the parents of the students in the classroom and inform them of the situation. c. A TEA waiver will not be necessary when a K-4th classroom exceeds the 22:1 ratio. d. This gives ZISD the flexibility without having the bureaucracy of waivers within the Texas Education Agency. 2. Teacher certification (DK LEGAL, DK LOCAL, DK EXHIBIT) (Ed. Code 21.003, 21.057) Currently In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must submit a request to the Texas Education Agency. TEA then approves or denies this request. There is a lot of bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork involved in the process. Proposed In order to best serve ZISD students, decisions on certification will be handled locally. a. The campus principal may submit to the superintendent a request to allow a certified teacher to teach one subject out of their certified field. The principal must specify in writing the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses which qualify this individual to teach this subject. b. An individual with experience in a CTE field could be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course through a local teaching certificate. The principal will submit the request to the superintendent with all the individual’s credentials. The superintendent will then approve the request if they feel the individual could be an asset to students. The superintendent will then report this action to the Board of Trustees prior to the individual beginning any employment. Local teaching certificates will be for one year. The employee will be at-will. ​3. School Start Date (TEC 25.0811a) (EB LEGAL) Currently TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. The current process allows no flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Proposed 1. Zavalla ISD students will begin instruction no earlier than the 3rd Monday of August. This change will create better flexibility in the creation of the district calendar as well as allowing more opportunities in scheduling meaningful and balanced staff development days. 2. The earlier start date will allow the district to move instructional days that occur after state mandated testing dates to the front of the school year. 3. The earlier start date will provide more balance to the first 3 six weeks grading periods during the first semester. 4.​ ​Teacher Contract days (DCB Legal, DCB Local) (Ed. Code 21.401) Current Current education law located in Chapter 21 defines a teacher contract as a ten month contract equivalent to 187 days. Proposed This plan reduces teacher contract days from 187 to 182 with no effect on teacher salaries. Being the smallest school in the county, it is difficult to compete with other larger county schools in the area of teacher salary. This reduction in contract days at the current salary schedule would make our salaries more competitive. 1 . This plan will increase the daily rate the district pays its teachers. 2. This plan should enhance teacher recruitment, therefore putting the district on a more level playing field with larger, county districts. 3. This plan will significantly improve teacher morale. 4. This plan will provide teachers more opportunities during the summer months to seek out beneficial staff development that relates to their field. 5. In the four other plan years, it will be part of the calendar planning process to maintain the reduced number of teacher contract days. 5. Teacher and Principal Evaluation (DNA LEGAL, DNA LOCAL)(Ed. Code 21.203, 21.352) (Ed. Code 21.3541) Currently The state of Texas has used the Professional Development and Appraisal System (PDAS) teacher appraisal system since 1997. The state is issuing a new teacher appraisal system in 2016-2017, that will be called the Texas Teacher Evaluation and Support System (T-TESS). Districts currently have the option to only formally appraise teachers once every five school years. Zavalla ISD teachers are formally evaluated at least once every two years. Principals must also complete one formal walk-through each 9-week grading period. New staff members will have two additional formal walkthroughs throughout the year. Principals are evaluated annually on a locally developed plan. Proposed A committee of administrators and teachers would have the option to develop a teacher evaluation system that would be a combination of PDAS, T-TESS, and other best practices to develop a local instrument that fits the needs and goals of ZISD. a. Zavalla ISD will create and utilize a locally developed teacher and principal evaluation tool. b. This instrument will be developed with input from central administration, campus administration, and teachers. It will use staff input, PDAS, T-TESS, T-PESS, and any other relevant best practice. c. Campus teachers must be formally evaluated at least every other year. d. All teachers will have an annual summative conference to discuss the year and to set personal goals and a staff development plan for the coming year. e. Principals will continue to be evaluated annually with locally developed instrument. f. These locally developed plans should reflect the strengths, areas of concern, and goals for Zavalla ISD. 6. Minimum Attendance for Class Credit of Final Grade (​TEC 25.092) TEC 25.092 states that except as provided by this section, a student in any grade level from kindergarten through grade twelve may not be given a final grade for a class unless the student is in attendance for at least 90% of the days the class is offered. This exemption will give needed flexibility for supporting students in dual enrollment and/or career preparation programs allowing for a flexible start and end date between the District and partnering businesses, colleges and/or universities. As ZISD continues to expand learning opportunities aligned with House Bill 5 and the Next Generation Accountability System, flexibility with “seat time” will be critical to ensure student internships are a viable means of accruing credit for relevant courses. ZISD will look to exercise this flexibility with Angelina College and local business partners.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yorktown Independent School District Final District of Innovation Plan 2017-2018 Introduction The 84th Legislature passed House Bill (HB) 1842 which gives traditional independent school districts most of the flexibilities available to the state’s open enrollment charter schools. HB 1842 provides Yorktown ISD an opportunity to modify state requirements at the local level to better meet the needs of our student population, in order to prepare them for success and life- long learning. Yorktown ISD took the first step in exploring this opportunity when the YISD Board of Trustees approved a resolution initiating the process in March after a public hearing to consider whether the district should develop an innovation plan, at which time the Board decided to move forward in the process. A committee was appointed to develop an innovation plan, and the plan was then created. The innovation plan will be posted online for at least 30 days. The committee will have a public meeting to approve the plan before it can be submitted to the Board. Goals • To utilize flexibility in meeting the growing needs of our students • To utilize the flexibility to use our personnel in the best way to facilitate this • To utilize the flexibility to plan and coordinate more effective professional development, • To utilize the flexibility to foster collaboration and planning between teachers • To utilize the flexibility to foster more positive teacher /parent interactions Process On March 20, 2017 the Yorktown ISD Board of Trustees voted to form a District of Innovation committee to pursue developing a plan for District of Innovation status following a public hearing at the March Regular Board Meeting. The committee was formed and met initially on March 27, 2017 to learn about Districts of Innovation and the process for becoming one. The committee met again on March 31, 2017 and began developing the plan and a calendar for the district. On April 6, 2017, the committee finalized the plan and it was posted to the district website on April 15, 2017 as the committee continued developing calendar options for the district. On April 17, 2017 a letter was sent to Commissioner Mike Morath at the Texas Education Agency notifying him of Yorktown ISD’s intent to pursue the District of Innovation Status. On April 28, 2017, Yorktown ISD’s Superintendent was notified by the Commissioner’s office of their receipt of the letter. On May 15, 2017 the District Committee met to approve the District of Innovation Plan for Yorktown ISD. District of Innovation District Committee Chad Gee, Superintendent Sylvia Hernandez, Curriculum Director Dr. Carlos Garza, Secondary Principal Pamela Edwards, Elementary Principal Nancy Gohmert, Secondary Counselor Dina Menn, Elementary Counselor and parent Kegan Perez, Junior High Teacher Jeanne Curbow, Junior High Teacher Caleb Gips, High School Teacher Tracy Heasley, Secondary SPED Teacher Carla Sullivan, Elementary Teacher and parent Stacey Gee, Elementary Teacher and parent Karen Casten, Elementary Teacher Sierra Ibrom, Elementary Teacher and parent Steven Gowens, Secondary Teacher and parent Lana Brysch, Community member Edie Boyd, Parent Adrianna Longoria, Parent Anna Foerster, Parent Megan Geffert, Parent Innovations Yorktown ISD, in conjunction with the District of Innovation Committee, proposes the following flexibilities with the Texas Education Code to provide the best and most innovative educational opportunities for students at YISD. _____________________________________________________________ 1. First and Last Day of Instruction (EB Legal) Exemption from: TEC 25.0811 TEC 25.0812 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. For many years this was the rule. However, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. • TEC 25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. Proposal: The district will develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in YISD by incorporating the flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, more focused and innovative professional development, and a school end date prior to June. By ending the school year earlier, YISD can support students who need remediation during the summer months, as well as students who are entering college or trade school. An earlier school start date allows students to register for summer classes and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time. 2. Minimum Minutes of Instruction per Day (EB Legal) Exemption from: TEC 25.081 TEC 25.082 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 25.081 requires that each school day must be 420 minutes long in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purposes and to accumulate instructional minutes toward the 75,600 minutes of instruction required for students annually. • TEC 25.082 provides that a school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses. Proposal: The district will consider altering the length of an instructional day on a limited basis when it is locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. Yorktown ISD does not have any intention to shorten the school day on a regular basis or without specific purpose (i.e. bad weather, professional development, early dismissal for events of community interest, for implementation of innovative instructional strategies, etc.). To the greatest extent possible, shortened days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees and published and distributed to stakeholders in advance of the school year and continuously published using school media. 3. Teacher Certification Requirements (DB Legal, DB Local, DBA Legal, DK Legal, DK Local) Exemption from: TEC 21.003 TEC 21.053 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher or other certified position unless the person holds an appropriate certificate. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board for Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. • TEC 21.053(b) states that an educator may not be paid for teaching or work done before the issuance of a valid certificate. Proposal: The district will maintain its current expectations for employee certification and will make every attempt to hire individuals with appropriate certifications for the position in question. The district will have the flexibility to hire individuals who are knowledgeable in the area and equipped to effectively perform the duties of the position in question. Yorktown ISD would like the ability to locally certify teachers in areas of high demand, to better meet the educational needs of our students. Such teachers would be employed on an at- will basis. The areas for this type of local certification would include, but are not limited to, CTE and languages other than English. Special Education teachers will continue to be required to hold a standard teaching certificate. Teachers with industry certifications and native speakers with qualified experience could be eligible to teach a course through a local teaching certification. Additionally, Yorktown ISD will notify parents if a locally certified teacher is employed for their child’s class. This process will allow more flexibility in our scheduling, and provide the ability to offer more innovative curriculum options for our students in class offerings leading to industry recognized certifications. __________________________________________________________________ 4. Probationary Contracts (DCA Legal) Exemption from: TEC 21.102(b) Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 21.102(b) states that a probationary contract period may not exceed one year for a person who has been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight years preceding employment with the district. Due to the unique nature of YISD, including our initiatives and processes, this period of time may not be sufficient to evaluate the teacher’s effectiveness in the classroom since teacher contract timelines demand that employment decisions must be made prior to the availability of end-of-year classroom and student data. Proposal: Upon exemption from TEC 21.102(b), all new contract certified employees subject to T.E.C. Chapter 21, will be subject to a two year probationary period in order to allow more time for the district to fairly and thoroughly assess an employee’s performance. Partial years will not count toward the full year requirement. For experienced teachers, counselors, or nurses new to the district who have been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight previous years, a probationary contract may be issued for up to two years. This strategy will give the District sufficient time to truly consider the performance of experienced teachers before having to make a decision to end their employment, and it will allow the school district the time to employ more innovative professional development strategies with teachers who may be struggling before having to make a decision to end employment. Teachers hired in the district with less than five of the previous eight years of experience may remain on probationary st...</td>\n",

       "0  LTISD Plan of Innovation LAKE TRAVIS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT -Effective Dec. 13, 2016 – Dec. 13, 2021 Frequently Asked Questions Nhat is a District of Innovation? Nhat are the benefits to Lake Travis ISD becoming a District of Innovation? Nhat are the proposed areas of innovation for Lake Travis ISD? Nhat areas is Lake Travis ISD prohibited from seeking exemption? What is a District of Innovation? The District of Innovation concept was passed by the 84th Legislative Session in House Bill 1842 and has been codified in the Texas Education Code Chapter 12a. A District of Innovation designation gives traditional school districts most of the flexibility currently available to Texas’ open-enrollment charter schools. It gives a district more local control and increases a district’s ability to decide what best suits the district’s needs. Under HB 1842, districts may identify certain requirements imposed by the Texas Education Code “that inhibit the goals of the plan and from which the district should exempt on adoption of the plan.” What are the benefits to Lake Travis ISD becoming a District of Innovation? A District of Innovation will have the flexibility to implement practices similar to charter schools and exercise local control over certain decisions about education and governance that are more appropriate for the individual needs of the District. A District of Innovation is given empowerment to innovate and think differently based on the unique needs of the school, students, and staff. Becoming a District of Innovation allows a district to customize appropriate plans district-wide, a grade level, or a single campus. What are the proposed areas of innovation for Lake Travis ISD?

What is the process for developing and approving LTISD’s Innovation Plan? On September 20, 2016, the Lake Travis ISD’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution to initiate the process of considering the designation of LTISD as a District of Innovation. The Board of Trustees appointed an innovation plan committee to explore and develop a local innovation plan. The innovation plan committee is comprised of key district stakeholders including, senior leadership, administration, staff, parents, board members, and community members. The innovation plan committee met in September, October, and November to draft, review, and prepare a final proposed Innovation Plan. The final proposed Innovation Plan will be posted on the District’s website for at least 30 days and can be accessed from the homepage at http://www.ltisdschools.org/. The District’s Advisory Committee for Education (ACE), established pursuant to Texas Education Code §11.251, will hold a public meeting on December 13, 2016 to consider and vote on the final version of the proposed plan. If the final proposed innovation plan is approved by a majority of the District’s ACE, the Board of Trustees will vote on whether to adopt the final proposed plan during the December 13, 2016 board meeting. If two-thirds of the membership of the board vote to adopt the plan, the District will be designated as a District of Innovation under Chapter 12a of the Texas Education Code and will begin operation in accordance with the plan. How long is the District of Innovation Plan effective? The plan will be in effect for a term of five years from the date of adoption (December 13, 2016 – December 13, 2021). The District of Innovation Plan may be amended, rescinded, or renewed only by a majority vote of the Innovation Plan Committee and the board of trustees in the same manner required for initial adoption. 3 http://www.ltisdschools.org/ Tlmellne Action Resoonsib11itv Date Action Responsibility Date Consideration of a designation by adoption of a resolution Board 9/20/16 Vote to adopt a resolution to consider designation Board 9/20/16 Hold a public hearing Board 9/20/16 Appoint a committee to develop a local innovation plan Board 9/20/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 9/22/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 10/6/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 11/2/16 Innovation Plan Committee meeting Committee 11/10/16 Post proposed local innovation plan on website District 11/11 – 12/12/16 Send notification to Commissioner of intention to vote on local innovation plan Board 11/11/16 First reading for local innovation plan Board 11/15/16 ACE public meeting to consider final version of the proposed plan; ACE to vote on final plan Committee 12/13/16 Board to vote on approval of final plan Board 12/13/16 Notification to Commissioner of approval of plan District 12/14/16 4 tim) i-, Q1>1 ~ E Q1>1 ~ Q1>1 Q1>1 ~ ;, ·r-r iliiiiiiil E E Q) u c m ~ c Q) iliiiiiiil ~ ;, m > Q) c c As hl ey G al le nk am p St ep ha ni e W ill ia m s De b Do lm an et Al ic ia M ar tin ez -D ur an El oi sa C er ni ck y De ni se H am ilt on Co lle en S er fo ss Ci nd y Al le n Ca ra C oo pe r Va ne ss a M al on e La ur en C ha m be rs Co ur tn ey T rim m er Jil l B ry an t M ar y N as ci m be ni Ka re n Fr ey Ke lly F re ed Pe rr is Ya te s M in dy P la nt e Ad el iza T iff an y Ka tie T ho m ps on Sh an no n Vo ge s M ic ha el B er ry Be at riz L op ez Ke vi n M al an dr uc co lo He at he r W rig ht Sh ar on S m ith Je nn y So ne s Go rd on B ut le r Da rn el l H or to n Am be r F or ge y Ja ni ce B ec h Ka th le en H as se nf ra tz Sa lli e In gl e Jo di e Vi lle m ai re Ka th y Bu rb an k Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Co un se lo r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pr in ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pa re nt * Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Co m m un ity * Te ac he r* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* Pr in ci pa l* As sis ta nt P rin ci pa l* Te ac he r* Te ac he r* C& I* Bu sin es s/ Co m m un ity * Pr in ci pa l* C& I* 5 Mary Patin Administration* Chief Todd Radford Business/Community* Holly Morris-Kuentz Administration Amber King Administration Marco Alvarado Administration Johnny Hill Administration Chris Woehl C&I Liz Sims C&I Rachel Benke C&I Brandy Belk Athletics Charles Aguillon Fine Arts Angela Frankhouser Principal Sam Hicks Principal April Glenn Principal Amanda Prehn Principal Alex Alexander Board Member Ex-Officio Lisa Johnson Board President Ex-Officio *Current Advisory Committee on Education Members 6 Innovation Plan As a District of Innovation, Lake Travis ISD seeks to maximize local control over educational and governance decisions for students and staff. To carry forward that mission, LTISD seeks exemption from the following provisions of the Texas Education Code. The District intends to continue to follow the Texas Education Code in all other areas. If amendments to this plan are considered at some point in the future, the District will reconvene the innovation plan committee to initiate the appropriate process, as outlined in Chapter 12a of the Texas Education Code. FIRST DAY OF INSTRUCTION (Texas Education Code § 25.0811) (EB LEGAL, EB LOCAL) Manner in which the statute inhibits the plan The Texas Education Code requires that students may not begin school before the fourth Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to begin school earlier. The waiver process was eliminated several years ago, mandating that all schools begin school no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. This requirement inhibits the District’s flexibility to develop a calendar that best meets students’, staff’s, board of trustees’, and community members’ needs and desires. It also inhibits the District from creating a calendar that better balances the instructional semesters. Category of innovation Modifications to the school year Innovation strategies 1. To allow for a calendar that fits the local needs of our community, the District will determine on an annual basis the local starting date for the first semester of each school year. 2. Students will begin no earlier than the second Monday in August of any given year. These strategies provide the District the benefits of additional time for staff to plan and students to learn; additional time for staff to prepare for summer school; equitable allocation of the days in the two semesters; additional professional learning community time for staff; flexibility to end the school year earlier, which in turn, allows staff and 7 http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.25.htm http://pol.tasb.org/Policy/Search/1154?filter=EB%20local students starting college the ability to access the first summer semester of college courses. CLASS SIZE IN GRADES K-4 (Texas Education Code §§ 25.112, 25.113) (BF LEGAL, EEB LEGAL) Manner in which the statute inhibits the plan The Texas Education Code currently requires the District to maintain a class size of 22 students or less in each kindergarten through fourth grade class.

       "1  Zephyr ISD District of Innovation Plan Introduction HB 1842 was passed during the 84th Texas Legislative Session in Spring 2015, and provides Texas public school districts the opportunity to be designated as Districts of Innovation. To access these flexibilities, a school district must adopt an innovation plan, as set forth in the Texas Education Code Chapter 12A. Districts of Innovation may be exempted from a number of state statutes and will have: · Greater local control as the decision makers over the educational and instructional model for students; · Increased freedom and flexibility, with accountability, relative to state mandates that govern educational programming; and · Empowerment to innovate and think differently. Districts are not exempt from statutes including curriculum and graduation requirements, and academic and financial accountability. Process On February 19th, 2018 the Zephyr Independent School District’s Board of Trustees passed a Resolution to Initiate the Process of Designation as a District of Innovation in order to support innovation and local initiatives to improve student learning. On February 19th, 2018 the Zephyr ISD Board of Trustees held a public hearing on whether the District should pursue the designation as a District of Innovation. The Board of Trustees acknowledged the District of Innovation Committee plans to discuss and draft this Local Innovation Plan. This committee represents various stakeholders across the district, including teachers, parents, campus administration, district administration, and Board of Trustees. The committee met on March 1st and 8th to discuss and develop the plan. The plan was posted on the district website March 9th, 2018. The District Site-Base Decision Making Committee, a body composed of representatives from all stakeholder groups within the district’s community, met on March 20th, 2018. If a majority of their membership approves the plan, it will go to the Board on April 16th, 2018. Term The District of Innovation Plan will become effective in September 2018 and will remain in effect for five years, through June 2023, unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the law. Any amendment to the Innovation Plan must follow the same process as the plan development. The District of Innovation Committee would consider any proposed amendment/s. Any amendment/s would require majority approval of the District of Innovation Committee, a majority approval of the District Site-Based Committee, and posting on the district website for 30 days. A 2/3 vote by the Board of Trustees would be required for final approval of any amendment/s. Zephyr I.S.D.

FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL (EB LEGAL) (Texas Education Code 25.0811) Current Law 25.0811 – (a) A school district may not begin instruction before the 4th Monday in August, unless the school operates year-round, or is the district has more than 190,000 students: the days are financed by local funds, or the campus is under comprehensive reform, or the majority of the students at the campus(es) are educationally disadvantaged. Proposed This flexibility of a start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. This flexibility of the start date also offers the following opportunities: a) This will allow the first and second semesters to be somewhat equal in the number of days of instruction. b) Students participating in Dual Enrollment opportunities will work with balanced semesters, which align with our local colleges. c) An early start date permits students an additional week of instruction prior to state assessments in December. d) Students will be afforded opportunities to enroll in summer college sessions with finalized official transcripts and staff will be able to attend summer school classes as well. e) This would allow an option to start school with a shorter week, easing the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. ZISD Local Guidelines The district will determine, on an annual basis, when each school year will begin. TEACHER CERTIFICATION (DK LEGAL, LOCAL) (Texas Education Code 21.003) Current Law In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must submit a request to the Texas Education Agency. TEA then approves or denies this request. In certain circumstances, a district can use a local one-year permit. Contracted staff is required to work 187 school days. Proposed In order to best serve Zephyr ISD students, decisions on certification will be handled locally. With the current teacher shortage, this exemption from teacher certification requirements will enable greater flexibility in staffing and will enrich applicant pools in specific areas of need. The district’s exemption from TEC 21.003 would allow the district to consider part-time professionals to teach courses, allow industry expert professionals to transition into the teaching profession in Career and Technology and also assist in staffing high need STEM and dual credit course offerings. Out-of-state certified teachers could be considered for positions upon a local review of experience, education and credentials. Often there are experienced certified teachers in our district that could teach a course outside of their certification area due to their education, background and/or experience. Local decisions outside of state certification requirements would allow innovation and flexibility in scheduling to meet student needs. This proposal will provide more flexibility in our scheduling and more options for our students in class offerings as well as providing condensed professional development for individual teacher learning. Local Guidelines a) The campus principal shall submit to the superintendent a request to allow a certified teacher to teach a subject and/or grade level out of their field. The principal must specify the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses qualifying this individual to teach the subject. b) An individual with experience in a Career and Technology field may be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course. An individual may hold a teaching certification in another state for core areas or Career and Technology. An individual may have background, experience, skills or work related/ industry experience to work full time or part-time in a designated area. The principal shall submit a request to the superintendent for local certification. The principal must specify the reason for the request and document what credentials the individual possesses qualifying this individual to teach the subject. c) The superintendent will approve or deny requests for local certification. INTER-DISTRICT TRANSFERS (FDA LOCAL) (Texas Education Code 25.036) Current Law Currently, under Texas Education Code 25.036, a district may choose to accept, as transfers, students who are not entitled to enroll in the district, but TEC 25.036, has been interpreted to require a transfer to be for a period of one school year. Proposed Zephyr ISD maintains a transfer policy under FDA (Local) requiring nonresident students wishing to transfer to file a transfer application each school year. In approving transfer requests, the availability of space and instructional staff, availability of programs and services, the student’s disciplinary history records, work habits, and attendance records are also evaluated. Transfer students are expected to follow the attendance requirements, rules, and regulations of the district. TEC 25.036 has been interpreted to establish the acceptance of a transfer as a one-year commitment by the district. The district is seeking to eliminate the provision of a one-year commitment in accepting transfer applicants. On rare occasions, student behavior warrants suspension (in or out of school), placement in a disciplinary alternative program, or expulsion. In addition, student attendance may fall below the TEA truancy standard. In these rare cases, Zephyr ISD seeks exemption from the one year transfer commitment. Local Guidelines Nonresident students who have been accepted as a district transfer student may have such transfer status revoked by the Superintendent at any time during the year if the student is assigned discipline consequences of suspension (in or out of ...   \n",

HB 1842 allows a traditional public school to have some of the same local flexibility that public charter schools have been allowed. Zavalla ISD believes this is a great opportunity for our local district to establish plans based on the unique needs of our students and community. This plan will be in effect for the 2017-2018 school year through the 2021-2022 school year. This plan may be amended at any time by the committee with approval of the Board of Trustees.

Submitting waivers for Kindergarten – Grade 4 class size (EEB LEGAL) (Ed. Code 25.112, 25.113) Currently Kindergarten – 4th Grade classes are to be kept at a 22 student to 1 teacher ratio according to state law. When a class exceeds this limit, the district must complete a waiver with the Texas Education Agency. These waivers are never rejected by TEA. This is a bureaucratic step that serves no purpose. Along with the waiver, it is required that a letter is sent home to each parent in the section that exceeds the 22:1 ratio, informing them the waiver has been submitted. Many times soon after the waiver is submitted, students move out of the district and we are below the 22:1 ratio. Proposed While we certainly believe that small class size plays a positive role in the classroom, we do not believe it has a negative effect when you only add one or two more students. Many times it is not the number of the students but the makeup and chemistry of the classroom which influence the learning environment. a. ZISD will attempt to keep all K-4th core classrooms to a 22:1 ratio. However, in the event the class size exceeds this ratio, the superintendent will report to the Board of Trustees. b. In the event a K-4th core classroom reaches 24:1, the campus will notify the parents of the students in the classroom and inform them of the situation. c. A TEA waiver will not be necessary when a K-4th classroom exceeds the 22:1 ratio. d. This gives ZISD the flexibility without having the bureaucracy of waivers within the Texas Education Agency. 2. Teacher certification (DK LEGAL, DK LOCAL, DK EXHIBIT) (Ed. Code 21.003, 21.057) Currently In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must submit a request to the Texas Education Agency. TEA then approves or denies this request. There is a lot of bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork involved in the process. Proposed In order to best serve ZISD students, decisions on certification will be handled locally. a. The campus principal may submit to the superintendent a request to allow a certified teacher to teach one subject out of their certified field. The principal must specify in writing the reason for the request and document what credentials the certified teacher possesses which qualify this individual to teach this subject. b. An individual with experience in a CTE field could be eligible to teach a vocational skill or course through a local teaching certificate. The principal will submit the request to the superintendent with all the individual’s credentials. The superintendent will then approve the request if they feel the individual could be an asset to students. The superintendent will then report this action to the Board of Trustees prior to the individual beginning any employment. Local teaching certificates will be for one year. The employee will be at-will. ​3. School Start Date (TEC 25.0811a) (EB LEGAL) Currently TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. The current process allows no flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Proposed 1. Zavalla ISD students will begin instruction no earlier than the 3rd Monday of August. This change will create better flexibility in the creation of the district calendar as well as allowing more opportunities in scheduling meaningful and balanced staff development days. 2. The earlier start date will allow the district to move instructional days that occur after state mandated testing dates to the front of the school year. 3. The earlier start date will provide more balance to the first 3 six weeks grading periods during the first semester. 4.​ ​Teacher Contract days (DCB Legal, DCB Local) (Ed. Code 21.401) Current Current education law located in Chapter 21 defines a teacher contract as a ten month contract equivalent to 187 days. Proposed This plan reduces teacher contract days from 187 to 182 with no effect on teacher salaries. Being the smallest school in the county, it is difficult to compete with other larger county schools in the area of teacher salary. This reduction in contract days at the current salary schedule would make our salaries more competitive. 1 . This plan will increase the daily rate the district pays its teachers. 2. This plan should enhance teacher recruitment, therefore putting the district on a more level playing field with larger, county districts. 3. This plan will significantly improve teacher morale. 4. This plan will provide teachers more opportunities during the summer months to seek out beneficial staff development that relates to their field. 5. In the four other plan years, it will be part of the calendar planning process to maintain the reduced number of teacher contract days. 5. Teacher and Principal Evaluation (DNA LEGAL, DNA LOCAL)(Ed. Code 21.203, 21.352) (Ed. Code 21.3541) Currently The state of Texas has used the Professional Development and Appraisal System (PDAS) teacher appraisal system since 1997. The state is issuing a new teacher appraisal system in 2016-2017, that will be called the Texas Teacher Evaluation and Support System (T-TESS). Districts currently have the option to only formally appraise teachers once every five school years. Zavalla ISD teachers are formally evaluated at least once every two years. Principals must also complete one formal walk-through each 9-week grading period. New staff members will have two additional formal walkthroughs throughout the year. Principals are evaluated annually on a locally developed plan. Proposed A committee of administrators and teachers would have the option to develop a teacher evaluation system that would be a combination of PDAS, T-TESS, and other best practices to develop a local instrument that fits the needs and goals of ZISD. a. Zavalla ISD will create and utilize a locally developed teacher and principal evaluation tool. b. This instrument will be developed with input from central administration, campus administration, and teachers. It will use staff input, PDAS, T-TESS, T-PESS, and any other relevant best practice. c. Campus teachers must be formally evaluated at least every other year. d. All teachers will have an annual summative conference to discuss the year and to set personal goals and a staff development plan for the coming year. e. Principals will continue to be evaluated annually with locally developed instrument. f. These locally developed plans should reflect the strengths, areas of concern, and goals for Zavalla ISD. 6. Minimum Attendance for Class Credit of Final Grade (​TEC 25.092) TEC 25.092 states that except as provided by this section, a student in any grade level from kindergarten through grade twelve may not be given a final grade for a class unless the student is in attendance for at least 90% of the days the class is offered. This exemption will give needed flexibility for supporting students in dual enrollment and/or career preparation programs allowing for a flexible start and end date between the District and partnering businesses, colleges and/or universities. As ZISD continues to expand learning opportunities aligned with House Bill 5 and the Next Generation Accountability System, flexibility with “seat time” will be critical to ensure student internships are a viable means of accruing credit for relevant courses. ZISD will look to exercise this flexibility with Angelina College and local business partners.   \n",

       "4  Yorktown Independent School District Final District of Innovation Plan 2017-2018 Introduction The 84th Legislature passed House Bill (HB) 1842 which gives traditional independent school districts most of the flexibilities available to the state’s open enrollment charter schools. HB 1842 provides Yorktown ISD an opportunity to modify state requirements at the local level to better meet the needs of our student population, in order to prepare them for success and life- long learning. Yorktown ISD took the first step in exploring this opportunity when the YISD Board of Trustees approved a resolution initiating the process in March after a public hearing to consider whether the district should develop an innovation plan, at which time the Board decided to move forward in the process. A committee was appointed to develop an innovation plan, and the plan was then created. The innovation plan will be posted online for at least 30 days. The committee will have a public meeting to approve the plan before it can be submitted to the Board. Goals • To utilize flexibility in meeting the growing needs of our students • To utilize the flexibility to use our personnel in the best way to facilitate this • To utilize the flexibility to plan and coordinate more effective professional development, • To utilize the flexibility to foster collaboration and planning between teachers • To utilize the flexibility to foster more positive teacher /parent interactions Process On March 20, 2017 the Yorktown ISD Board of Trustees voted to form a District of Innovation committee to pursue developing a plan for District of Innovation status following a public hearing at the March Regular Board Meeting. The committee was formed and met initially on March 27, 2017 to learn about Districts of Innovation and the process for becoming one. The committee met again on March 31, 2017 and began developing the plan and a calendar for the district. On April 6, 2017, the committee finalized the plan and it was posted to the district website on April 15, 2017 as the committee continued developing calendar options for the district. On April 17, 2017 a letter was sent to Commissioner Mike Morath at the Texas Education Agency notifying him of Yorktown ISD’s intent to pursue the District of Innovation Status. On April 28, 2017, Yorktown ISD’s Superintendent was notified by the Commissioner’s office of their receipt of the letter. On May 15, 2017 the District Committee met to approve the District of Innovation Plan for Yorktown ISD. District of Innovation District Committee Chad Gee, Superintendent Sylvia Hernandez, Curriculum Director Dr. Carlos Garza, Secondary Principal Pamela Edwards, Elementary Principal Nancy Gohmert, Secondary Counselor Dina Menn, Elementary Counselor and parent Kegan Perez, Junior High Teacher Jeanne Curbow, Junior High Teacher Caleb Gips, High School Teacher Tracy Heasley, Secondary SPED Teacher Carla Sullivan, Elementary Teacher and parent Stacey Gee, Elementary Teacher and parent Karen Casten, Elementary Teacher Sierra Ibrom, Elementary Teacher and parent Steven Gowens, Secondary Teacher and parent Lana Brysch, Community member Edie Boyd, Parent Adrianna Longoria, Parent Anna Foerster, Parent Megan Geffert, Parent Innovations Yorktown ISD, in conjunction with the District of Innovation Committee, proposes the following flexibilities with the Texas Education Code to provide the best and most innovative educational opportunities for students at YISD. _____________________________________________________________ 1. First and Last Day of Instruction (EB Legal) Exemption from: TEC 25.0811 TEC 25.0812 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. For many years this was the rule. However, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. • TEC 25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. Proposal: The district will develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in YISD by incorporating the flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, more focused and innovative professional development, and a school end date prior to June. By ending the school year earlier, YISD can support students who need remediation during the summer months, as well as students who are entering college or trade school. An earlier school start date allows students to register for summer classes and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time. 2. Minimum Minutes of Instruction per Day (EB Legal) Exemption from: TEC 25.081 TEC 25.082 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 25.081 requires that each school day must be 420 minutes long in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purposes and to accumulate instructional minutes toward the 75,600 minutes of instruction required for students annually. • TEC 25.082 provides that a school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses. Proposal: The district will consider altering the length of an instructional day on a limited basis when it is locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. Yorktown ISD does not have any intention to shorten the school day on a regular basis or without specific purpose (i.e. bad weather, professional development, early dismissal for events of community interest, for implementation of innovative instructional strategies, etc.). To the greatest extent possible, shortened days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees and published and distributed to stakeholders in advance of the school year and continuously published using school media. 3. Teacher Certification Requirements (DB Legal, DB Local, DBA Legal, DK Legal, DK Local) Exemption from: TEC 21.003 TEC 21.053 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher or other certified position unless the person holds an appropriate certificate. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board for Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. • TEC 21.053(b) states that an educator may not be paid for teaching or work done before the issuance of a valid certificate. Proposal: The district will maintain its current expectations for employee certification and will make every attempt to hire individuals with appropriate certifications for the position in question. The district will have the flexibility to hire individuals who are knowledgeable in the area and equipped to effectively perform the duties of the position in question. Yorktown ISD would like the ability to locally certify teachers in areas of high demand, to better meet the educational needs of our students. Such teachers would be employed on an at- will basis. The areas for this type of local certification would include, but are not limited to, CTE and languages other than English. Special Education teachers will continue to be required to hold a standard teaching certificate. Teachers with industry certifications and native speakers with qualified experience could be eligible to teach a course through a local teaching certification. Additionally, Yorktown ISD will notify parents if a locally certified teacher is employed for their child’s class. This process will allow more flexibility in our scheduling, and provide the ability to offer more innovative curriculum options for our students in class offerings leading to industry recognized certifications. __________________________________________________________________ 4. Probationary Contracts (DCA Legal) Exemption from: TEC 21.102(b) Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC 21.102(b) states that a probationary contract period may not exceed one year for a person who has been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight years preceding employment with the district. Due to the unique nature of YISD, including our initiatives and processes, this period of time may not be sufficient to evaluate the teacher’s effectiveness in the classroom since teacher contract timelines demand that employment decisions must be made prior to the availability of end-of-year classroom and student data. Proposal: Upon exemption from TEC 21.102(b), all new contract certified employees subject to T.E.C. Chapter 21, will be subject to a two year probationary period in order to allow more time for the district to fairly and thoroughly assess an employee’s performance. Partial years will not count toward the full year requirement. For experienced teachers, counselors, or nurses new to the district who have been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight previous years, a probationary contract may be issued for up to two years. This strategy will give the District sufficient time to truly consider the performance of experienced teachers before having to make a decision to end their employment, and it will allow the school district the time to employ more innovative professional development strategies with teachers who may be struggling before having to make a decision to end employment. Teachers hired in the district with less than five of the previous eight years of experience may remain on probationary st...   \n",

       "757    BLUM Independent School District District of Innovation Plan June 2017-May 2022 1 A District of Innovation is a concept passed by the 84th Legislative Session in House Bill 1842 that allows school districts greater local control and flexibility regarding certain state-level regulations in an effort to utilize the designation to better serve students. The proposed plan, once adopted, will remain in effect for the next five years (June 2017-May 2022). The plan may be amended at any time by the District of Innovation Committee with the approval of the school board.

Code 25.0811(a)) FIRST DAY OF INSTRUCTION (a) Except as provided by this section, a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. Proposed Blum ISD, who does not qualify for any of the exceptions noted in the statute, would like to have the freedom to develop a calendar that better fits the needs of the community should the committee choose. Having greater flexibility in this area would allow the District Committee to better balance the first and second semesters and provide more instructional days prior to state testing. SCHOOL DAY INTERRUPTIONS (EC Local) (Ed. Code 25.083(a)) SCHOOL DAY INTERRUPTIONS. (a) The board of trustees of each school district shall adopt and strictly enforce a policy limiting interruptions of classes during the school day for nonacademic activities (such as announcements) to once during the school day except in the case of an Emergency. Proposed Blum ISD would like to have the freedom to make announcements as needed during picture days and other days that are not routine for greater efficiency. LENGTH OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAY (Ed. Code 25.081, 25.082(a)) LENGTH OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAY. Sec. 25.081. OPERATION OF SCHOOLS. (a) Except as authorized under Subsection (b) of this section, Section 25.084, or Section 29.0821, for each school year each school district must operate so that the district provides for at least 75,600 minutes of instruction, including intermissions and recesses, for students. (b)The commissioner may approve the instruction of students for fewer than the number of minutes required under Subsection (a) if disaster, flood, extreme weather conditions, fuel curtailment, or another calamity causes the closing of schools. (c)If the commissioner does not approve reduced instruction time under Subsection (b), a school district may add additional minutes to the end of the district’s normal school hours as necessary to compensate for minutes of instruction lost due to school closures caused by disaster, flood, extreme weather conditions, fuel curtailment, or another calamity. 3 (d)The commissioner may adopt rules for the application, on the basis of the minimum minutes of instruction required by Subsection(a), of any provision of this title that refers to a minimum number of days of instruction under this section. (e)For purposes of this code, a reference to a day of instruction means 420 minutes of instruction, SCHOOL DAY; PLEDGES OF ALLEGIANCE; MINUTE OF SILENCE. Sec. 25.082. (a) A school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses. Proposed Exemption from the 420-minute day requirement would allow Blum ISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule on selected days whenever it was locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. While there is a waiver process available to request exemption from this requirement, the waiver is limited to a 6-day maximum number for the school year. Exempting completely from the 420-minute requirement would give the district a significant amount of local control over scheduling (above and beyond the 6-day maximum as needed) without the fear of diminishing state funding or losing credit for instructional time that might cause the district to fall out of compliance with annual minute requirements. This would allow the district the flexibility to schedule non-instructional days into the schedule to allow for teachers to analyze student data and engage in targeted, relevant professional development. Blum ISD does not have any intentions to shorten the school day on a regular basis or without specific purpose. To the greatest extent possible, “early release” days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees and published and distributed to stakeholders in advance of the school year and continuously published using school media. 90 PERCENT ATTENDANCE RULE (TEC 25.092) MINIMUM ATTENDANCE FOR CLASS CREDIT OR FINAL GRADE. (a) Except as provided by this section, a student in any grade level from kindergarten through grade 12 may not be given credit or a final grade for a class unless the student is in attendance for at least 90 percent of the days the class is offered. (a-1) A student who is in attendance for at least 75 percent but less than 90 percent of the days a class is offered may be given credit or a final grade for the class if the student completes a plan approved by the school's principal that provides for the student to meet the instructional requirements of the class. A student under the jurisdiction of a court in a criminal or juvenile justice proceeding may not receive credit or a final grade under this subsection without the consent of the judge presiding over the student's case. Proposed The 90 percent rule is an arbitrary percentage. District should have the option to set their own requirement. Local districts need the flexibility to set attendance requirements which reflect their specific situations and expectations. 4 Abstaining from the requirement means the district won’t have to penalize students who miss class due to extra/co-curricular activities, academic activities, or other extenuating circumstances. The flexibility can allow for local boards to set higher expectations for attendance while promoting students engagement, as well as social and emotional development by encouraging more students to participate in extracurricular activities. It must be noted, relief from Section 25.092 does not in any way impact or alter existing compulsory attendance requirements or University Interscholastic League (UIL) rules. Opting out of Section 25.092 in no way limits or modifies a teacher’s right to determine the finality of a grade in accordance with Texas Education Code Section 28.0214, nor does it restrict or alter a teacher’s right to assign grades in accordance with Texas Education Code Section 28.0216. ABSENCES FOR COLLEGE VISITS (Ed. Code 25.087 (b-2)) EXCUSED ABSENCES. (b-2) A school district may excuse a student from attending school to visit an institution of higher education accredited by a generally recognized accrediting organization during the student’s junior and senior years of high school for the purpose of determining the student’s interest in attending the institution of higher education, provided that: (1)the district may not excuse for this purpose more than two days during the student’s junior year and two days during the student’s senior year; and (2)The district adopts: (A) a policy to determine when an absence will be excused for this purpose; and (B) a procedure to verify the student’s visit at the institution of higher education Proposed Currently students are only allowed to have two excused school days to visit college or universities as college days. In some cases, where students are visiting colleges out of state, students need more than the two days that are currently allowed to safely visit a college they are interested in attending or doing comparative visits to multiple colleges. Blum ISD will be exempt from the two-day excused absence limit for students visiting institutions of higher education. Students would be allowed more than the current two-day excused absence limit. Each situation would be evaluated by the counselor on a case by case basis. LOCAL ROLE IN TEACHER AND PRINCIPAL EVALUATION (DNA LEGAL) (Texas Education Code 21.352, 21.353, 21.354, 21.3541) TEC §21.352 In appraising teachers, each school district shall use the appraisal process and performance criteria developed by the commissioner or an appraisal process and performance criteria developed by the district- and campus-level committees established under Section 11.251, containing the items described by Sections 21.351(a)(1) and (2), and adopted by the board of trustees. The board of trustees may reject an appraisal process and performance criteria developed by the district- and campus-level committees but may not modify the process or criteria. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, appraisal must be done at least once during each school year. A teacher may be appraised less frequently if the teacher agre...\n",
