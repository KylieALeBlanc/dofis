      "https://s3.amazonaws.com/scschoolfiles/389/alpine_isd__district_of_innovation_plan_-_final_approved.pdf|25.036) (FDA LOCAL) Alpine ISD Board Goal - 1 Current Law Currently, under Texas Education Code 25.036, a district may choose to accept, as transfers, students who are not entitled to enroll in the district, but TEC 25.036, has been interpreted to require a transfer to be for a period of one school year. Proposed The district is seeking to eliminate the provision of a one school year commitment in accepting transfer students. Transfer students will be admitted upon district approval, following district requirements and procedures. Transfer students not meeting the local guidelines, may be subject to immediate revocation of the transfer status. Alpine ISD Local Guidelines Transfers shall be granted for one school year at a time, based on the transfer requirements, available space, and instructional staff. A new, written application shall be required for each school year that a transfer is sought. Nonresident students, who voluntarily withdraw from Alpine ISD during the school year, will not be permitted to reapply for transfer status during that same school year. Transfer students may have their transfer status immediately revoked if they do not meet the following academic and conduct requirements: 1. Maintain at least a 90 percent attendance rate. 2. Maintain at least a 70 average in all core subjects. 3. Demonstrate competency on state assessments, if applicable and/or pass appropriate state assessments. 4. Comply with the Student Code and Conduct and maintain good conduct. Any assignment, to an in- school suspension program, disciplinary alternative education program, suspension, and/or felony conviction is not considered good conduct. Transfer students shall be subject to the same disciplinary consequences as all other Alpine ISD students. Approved: June 28, 2017 - Alpine ISD Board of Trustees Alpine ISD will attempt to provide the same resources to transfer students, as all other students receive, prior to their transfer status being revoked. The resources include, academic tutorials and assistance, behavioral interventions, parent/guardian meetings, and private conversations with the campus counselor. A transfer student, whose transfer status is revoked, is not permitted to reapply for transfer status during that same school year. The principal and/or counselor, with teacher input, will review the parameters of the transfer student agreement each grading cycle to determine if there are any violation of the terms within the agreement. LENGTH OF SCHOOL DAY (Texas Education Code 25.082(a)) (EC LEGAL) Board Goal – 1, 2 Currently Law Currently, under Texas Education Code 25.082(a), a school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses. Proposed Exemption from the seven hour or 420‐minute day requirement would allow Alpine ISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule on selected days, whenever it is locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. While there is a waiver process available to request an exemption from this requirement, the waiver is limited to a 6‐day maximum number for the school year. This exemption would give the district a significant amount of local control over scheduling, above and beyond the 6 day maximum as needed. This would allow the district the flexibility to schedule non‐ instructional time into the schedule to allow teachers to analyze student data and engage in targeted, relevant professional development. Alpine ISD Guidelines Based on specific needs, each campus will have scheduling flexibility which may result in less than a 420- minute day. All scheduling decisions will be geared towards maximized instructional time, and will focus on student needs, development levels and skills. Campus schedules, with less than 420-minutes days, will be approved by the superintendent. All students will receive the required 75,600 minutes of instruction as required each school year.
