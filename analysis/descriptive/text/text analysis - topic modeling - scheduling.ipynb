       "['|25.0811; TEC §25.0812 TEC §25.0811 states a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. TEC §25.0812 states a school district may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15 Innovation: Abernathy ISD believes that increased flexibility in determining the start and end of the instructional calendar will increase student achievement, improve attendance, and better allow the district to meet the social and emotional needs of the students.

Innovation for the AISD: • The state requires that school districts not begin instruction for students for a school year prior to the fourth Monday in August. This creates challenges, including significant disparities in the number of instructional days provided in each of the two school year semesters as well as potential challenges related to the effective pacing of instruction within the school calendar. This exemption will provide the opportunity to develop a school calendar that promotes improved balance in the number of instructional days each semester in order to positively impact the academic performance and outcomes of students. Implementat ion Considerat ions: • The AISD calendar committee will convene annually to collaboratively develop and recommend a district calendar that is designed to promote the effective delivery of classroom instruction and school/district operations. ! ! Proposed Innovations Last Day of Instruction TEC Code Requir ing Exemption: • TEC §25.0812: Requires that school districts may not schedule the last day of school for students before May 15. Innovation for the AISD: • The state requires that school districts may not schedule the last day of school for students before May 15. This requirement conflicts with the academic calendar for students attending classes at specialized schools such as Arlington Collegiate High School and the STEM Academy. This exemption provides students attending specialized campuses the ability to align their schedules with the calendar of Tarrant County College (TCC) or other institutions of higher education. Alignment with institutions of higher education would allow students to accelerate academically by completing courses during non-traditional semesters, which may include, winter-mester, May-mester and summer sessions. Students would also have an opportunity to acquire an associate’s degree in less than four years, enabling them to pursue courses at a four-year university. Implementat ion Considerat ions: • Students enrolled at ACHS as full-time college students (11th and 12th grade) would be able to align their academic calendar with the institution of higher education. • 11th and 12th graders would have the opportunity to advance academically by taking mini- mester courses in the winter, May and/or summer. It could also give students access to special programs (occurring during mini-mesters) to be developed in partnership with four- year universities. • Students enrolled in ninth and 10th grade would follow an academic calendar similar to that of the AISD • There would be no impact on teacher contracts as ACHS 11th and 12th graders are taught by TCC faculty.

Flexibility to begin instruction earlier in the calendar year. This will enable the District to improve active learning by balancing the amount of instructional time in the semesters, which will allow teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after the winter break. In addition, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. b.

A school district may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15. Rationale for Innovations The district needs the flexibility to begin the instructional year before the 4th Monday in August to prevent the loss of instructional time and to provide more days of uninterrupted time for teachers to plan and prepare for instruction. This would also allow for more creative scheduling for extra-curricular activities, such as athletics and band. Adjusting the first and last day of instruction will allow flexibility in scheduling holidays, as well as scheduling periodic breaks for staff and students to re-energize and refocus after grading cycles. Strategically planned breaks will reduce stress, anxiety, fatigue, and absenteeism. Having the flexibility to adjust the first and last day of instruction will allow the district to better balance instructional days during the first and second semester. Adjustments to the first and last day of school will allow the district to strategically embed professional learning days and additional opportunities for teacher planning and preparation. This flexibility would also allow the district to end the school year prior to Memorial Day. Austin ISD believes the local community should decide what is best for its students and staff when developing its calendar.

There is a lack of flexibility in the calendar process to fit the needs of the community or the plans and wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent the community. Innovation Strategies 1. Bellevue ISD will begin instruction before the 4th day of August in an effort to create greater flexibility in the school calendar. 2. The earlier start date will also offer more preparation time for staff and students to prepare for state mandated testing. 3. The flexibility will also provide more time for staff development days throughout the calendar year. BELLEVUE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT P. O.

GOAL #2 Length of the School Day (TEC 25.082)(SAAH 3.8.1) TEC 25.082 states that a school day must be 7 hours each day including recess and intermissions. SAAH 3.8.1 states that a school day must be at least 420 minutes including recesses and intermissions. School districts are subject to this requirement. The current rules allow no flexibility in the design of district and campus schedules. Innovation Strategies 1. The opportunity to exempt from the 420 minute school day requirement will provide the district the opportunity to provide each campus the flexibility of creating a daily schedule that will better serve the students and teachers on each campus. This flexibility will give local control to the district in meeting the yearly requirement of 75,600 minutes in relation to the district calendar for each specific school year. 2. This exemption will also allow greater flexibility than the current 6 day waiver maximum that relates to the length of the school day. 3. The district will provide teachers and administrators the opportunity for weekly and monthly staff development opportunities through the creation of these unique schedules.

This calendar may move the State mandated start date to an earlier date. Having this flexibility will allow the District to schedule instruction and professional development in the most effective ways for students and staff and will promote innovation in instructional strategies, scheduling, and professional development that the district believes will yield higher scores and a better all-around balanced education for our students.

       " '|25.0811) The Strategic Plan emphasizes the importance of responsive learning environments, students reaching their full potential, and the importance of students producing authentic work products that are indicative of high-level thinking and incorporate 21st Century skills. Texas Education Code Section 25.0811 inhibits these goals by prohibiting the District from beginning instruction before the fourth Monday in August. Flexibility to begin instruction earlier in the calendar year will enable the District to be more responsive to students by balancing the amount of instructional time in the semesters, which will allow teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after the winter break. Another important consideration is the fact that by delaying the start of school, summer activities are pushed later into June. Thus, things such as summer school, summer enrichment programs, and other sports activities are delayed because of starting school later. In addition, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. Finally, for students transitioning from elementary school to middle school, and from middle school to high school, starting the school year earlier will promote social and emotional learning by giving those students additional time and support to enable them to adjust socially and emotionally to their new campus environments. C. Length of School Day (TEC 25.082) The Strategic Plan calls for innovativeness and responsiveness, as well as stresses the importance of collaboration. Districts have become so constrained by efforts to meet time requirements that are based upon a model of schooling that dates back to the 19th Century. Now that technology has become ubiquitous, students now have access to information and personalized learning pathways that expand learning beyond brick and mortar. No longer is learning time restricted by the number of hours in a school day. As long as students have access to the curriculum, learning time can actually be expanded depending upon connectivity and accessibility to alternate tools and resources. Using time differently can actually provide the coveted time that is necessary for different types of face-to-face interactions, such as student-to-student, student-to-teacher, and teacher-to-teacher. This recaptured time can be used in more innovative ways because instruction is delivered through different formats, using more prescriptive and personalized resources. The Texas Education Code Section 25.082 inhibits this plan by not allowing the District to have flexibility in moving from a “seat time” model to a “mastery learning-time model,” which awards credit based on student mastery of the content as opposed to the student simply meeting class time/school day time requirements.

We value and support the contributions of our staff, and we value the collaborative partnerships as vital to strengthening the learning experience. Designation of the fourth Monday in August as the first day the district may begin instruction for students restricts the District’s ability to provide balanced semesters, create more time before state testing dates, align with college semesters for students taking dual credit classes, collaboratively determine with local partners on how best to strengthen the learning experience. By obtaining exemption from TEC §25.0811, the District will be better able to create balanced grading periods while still ending the first semester prior to the holiday break and aligns with the local community college semester dates. In addition, the district will also be able to start school mid-week, allowing for a smoother transition at the beginning of school.

(Board Policy Ref: EB (Legal) School Year) NOTE: Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs. Bryan ISD will continue to comply with the UIL calendar for summer practices and will not move summer practices earlier, despite potentially moving up the start date of school. B. Challenges/Obstacles: The increasingly later start date for instruction has presented numerous challenges and obstacles to Bryan ISD’s academic operations. Fall and Spring semesters are significantly unequal in length; opportunities for collaborative teacher planning/preparation time are reduced, the last day of instruction gets pushed farther into June which negatively affects summer programming and some students or staff who wish to attend universities and colleges in the summer miss the first days of college classes. Unequal semesters also negatively affect one-semester classes because the same curriculum still must be taught in fewer instructional days. The shortened instructional period makes it more difficult for students to master concepts and increases out of school assignments. In addition, teachers and campus administrators place value on strategically scheduled professional development days in each semester to assist campuses in analyzing student performance and planning. The late school start date interferes with developing an academic calendar that meets stakeholder desires and prohibits balancing the Fall and Spring semesters. Unbalanced semesters negatively affect student learning, cause low staff morale in the spring due to a later ending date, and reduce teacher preparation time. C. Proposed Innovation/Benefits: Bryan ISD will no longer be required to delay the start of school to the fourth Friday in August as currently required by TEC § 25.0811. Upon implementation of the DOI Plan, the District will determine an appropriate start date annually that does not occur before the second Monday in August.

Sec. 25.0812. LAST DAY OF SCHOOL. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), a school district may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15. Proposed: The flexibility of start and end date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. The district calendar is created and approved by a district committee consisting of parents, community representatives, teachers, and administrators. The district approved calendar is then approved by the school board and distributed to the staff via email and put on the district’s website. This empowers BISD to personalize learning, increase college and career readiness, and balance the amount of instructional time per semester. Exemption from the uniform start date allows for the flexibility of starting classes as a short week, easing the transition for students entering elementary school, middle school, and high school. In addition, by having the flexibility in the start and end of the school year, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness.

       " '|25.0811: A school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. (School Year - Board Policy EB (Legal)) The increasingly later start date for instruction has presented numerous challenges for Caldwell ISD. Fall and Spring semesters are significantly unequal in length, the summer programs will potentially be negatively impacted by the last day of instruction. Unequal semesters also negatively affect one-semester classes because the same curriculum must still be taught in fewer instructional days. The shortened instructional period makes it more difficult for students to master concepts and increases out of school assignments. Teachers and campus administrators place value on strategically scheduled professional development days in each semester to assist campuses in analyzing student performance and planning. The late school start date interferes with developing an academic calendar that meets stakeholder desires and prohibits balancing the Fall and Spring semesters. Unbalanced semesters negatively affect student learning, cause low staff morale in the spring due to a later ending date. Innovation Caldwell ISD will no longer be required to delay the start of school as currently required by TEC § 25.0811. Upon implementation of the DOI Plan, the District will determine an appropriate start date annually that does not occur before the second Monday in August. Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs.

CCISD must follow TEC:§25.0811 First Day of Instruction- States that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. CCISD would benefit from greater flexibility than TEC:§25.0811 allows. Keeping a uniform start date creates an imbalance in numbers of days each semester, places most professional development days before knowledge about students is acquired and does not allow for all district curriculum to be taught prior to state testing. Proposed: The committee agrees that CCISD students would benefit from starting school no earlier than the second Monday in August to ensure: 1. Better balance between first and second semester. 2. Flexibility for annual calendars to address variances in dates as well as honor community needs. 3.

Historically, the preference has been for the calendar to be set for the first semester to be completed prior to the Christmas break. It is also desirable for the fall and spring semesters to be as equal in length as possible to allow semester-long or one-half credit courses to have ample time for students to master the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills of each course. Without the ability to start school earlier than allowable by law, the public school year often overlaps with the beginning of the college 6 summer session. Students desiring to enroll in summer college courses, which begin in early June, would have that ability. Maximizing instructional time prior to state assessments, allocating time for appropriate planning, and managing student focus and behavior are each affected by the school calendar.

Because the community expects the fall semester to end with final exams before the winter break, the restricted start date creates a significant imbalance in the number of instructional days in each semester. By starting earlier, not only will there be greater balance, which is 5 particularly important in semester long courses, but it will also allow more instructional days prior to state testing dates. Starting school early has many advantages; however, starting the school year too early has disadvantages. A substantial number of students begin participating in UIL activities the first and second week of August (athletics and band activities, for example). By restricting the first day of school to the fourth Monday of August, these students have their summer break significantly reduced. This affects family vacation plans, college preparation activities, and may even prevent students from participating in these UIL events and activities. Flexibility in these situations will allow CISD to adjust to the betterment of as many students as possible. Shortening the winter holiday in our district deters attendance, affecting end of semester grades and weighted average daily attendance (WADA). Winter Break is historically a minimum of two full calendar weeks, which gives families sufficient time to celebrate the holidays and take family vacations. The restricted start date forces CISD to shorten the winter break in order to have sufficient instructional days and final exams before the winter break. Rather than forego traditional family celebrations and vacations over the winter break, some parents will elect to begin their winter break early. This will result in increased absenteeism, affecting both end of semester grades and CISD’s WADA. The exemption could result in an earlier end date, closer to the Memorial Day holiday, which is also an expressed preference of the community. Finishing school closer to the Memorial Day holiday will better allow students to enroll in summer school classes within CISD as well as institutions of higher learning. Local Innovation Strategy A. In consultation with staff and community stakeholders, CISD Calendar Committee will develop its annual calendar recommendation for approval by the Board of Trustees. Through the exemption, the first day of instruction can begin prior to the fourth Monday in August. Preference will be given to starting instruction around the third week in August with assurances to the community the school year will not begin prior to the second week in August. 2.

       " '|25.0811: A school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. (Board Policy Ref: EB (Legal) School Year) DIP References: Guiding Objective 1, Guiding Objective 2, Guiding Objective 4 Challenges/Obstacles: The increasingly later start date for instruction has presented numerous challenges and obstacles to District academic operations. Fall and spring semesters are significantly unequal in length; opportunities for collaborative teacher planning and preparation time are reduced, the last day of instruction gets pushed farther into June which negatively affects summer programming and some students and staff who wish to attend universities and colleges in the summer miss the first days of college classes. In the past, to attempt to balance the semesters due to a late start date, CFB ended the first semester after the winter break. This strategy created hardships for students who were required to work on significant projects during the holidays. The break from instruction near the end of the semester also made it more difficult for students to prepare for semester examinations. The unequal semesters also negatively affects one semester classes such as health, AP Psychology, Professional Communications, Economics, etc. because the same curriculum still must be taught in fewer instructional days. The shortened instructional period makes it more difficult for students to master the concepts and increases out of school assignments. Each year, consistent with its local policy, CFBISD seeks input from stakeholders about the academic calendar. Stakeholder input following the change in the end of the fall semester overwhelmingly communicated the desire to end the fall semester before the holiday break even if it resulted in unbalanced semesters. The longstanding and consistent input that the District has received from internal and external stakeholders since that time is that they desire to (i) complete the fall semester before the winter break, (ii) have the last day of instruction fall in the last week of May, (iii) retain a Fair Day holiday in October, and (iv) have the week of Thanksgiving as a fall break. In addition, teachers and campus administrators value strategically placed professional development days in each semester to assist campuses in analyzing student performance and planning. The late school start date interferes with developing an academic calendar that meets stakeholder desires as well as implementing best practices of balancing the fall and spring semesters, negatively affects student learning, causes low staff morale in the spring due to a later ending date, and reduces teacher preparation time. Proposed Innovation/Benefits: CFBISD will no longer be required to delay the start of school to the fourth Friday in August as currently required by TEC § 25.0811. Upon implementation of the DOI Plan, the District will determine an appropriate start date annually. CFBISD will continue to consider stakeholder input as required by Board policy EB (Local) in its determination of the first day of instruction. A more reasonable school start date will provide CFBISD flexibility to incorporate stakeholder input into its calendar process, increase stakeholder satisfaction, allow for a more balanced academic calendar, provide more opportunities for collaborative teacher planning and preparation time and professional development throughout the year at times best suited to instructional needs, and generally improve the overall efficient operations of the District. The maintenance of good professional development is directly related to student success. Note: Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs. CFBISD will continue to comply with the UIL calendar for commencement of summer practices. Length of Instructional Day Statutory Exemption(s): Texas Education Code §|25.0811.

In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board for Educator Certification. Rationale for innovation Original Board Approval 3/23/2017 Revised Board Approval 4/9/2018 House Bill 5 has added significant support for the need to expand college and career opportunities for students. However, the current certification requirements inhibit the district’s ability to hire professionals with industry experience to teach Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses, such as welding, health sciences, architecture, and construction. Additionally, in the event that the district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of his or her certification area, the district must request emergency certification from TEA and/or the State Board of Educator Certification. These requests may be denied. This process is time consuming, burdensome, and it may not allow the district to meet its instructional needs in a timely fashion. With the growing teacher shortage in Texas, this process may prevent the district from being able to hire the best teacher available. Flexibility to establish its own teacher certification requirements for instructors directly benefits students in the following ways: \\uf0b7 Expert industry certified and/or trade professionals to teach specialized certification courses \\uf0b7 Greater number of course offerings resulting in more opportunities for students \\uf0b7 Greater opportunity for students to obtain professional certifications \\uf0b7 Innovation and flexibility in scheduling to meet student needs \\uf0b7 Added flexibility to hire the best candidate for each position The district does not wish to be exempted from any existing statutes relating to certified teacher contracts or teacher benefits. Innovative strategies The district will maintain its current expectations for employee certification. The district will make every attempt to hire individuals with appropriate certification and skills for the position available; however, where that is not reasonably possible, the district will have the flexibility to hire individuals who are knowledgeable in the area and equipped to effectively perform the duties of the teaching positon in question. The district’s Board of Trustees would be able to issue an innovation permit for an individual teaching courses based on qualifications certified by the superintendent. The individual qualifications would include demonstrated subject matter expertise, such as: \\uf0b7 Professional work experience \\uf0b7 Formal training and education \\uf0b7 Relevant industry license, certification, or registration \\uf0b7 Combination of work experience, training, and education \\uf0b7 Demonstration of successful experience working with students All candidates would be carefully considered to ensure the individual has sufficient education and expertise to provide instruction necessary to meet the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for the course(s) to be taught. Special education and bilingual teachers will continue to be required to hold appropriate state teaching certificates. Before issuing an innovation permit to an individual, the district would ensure that the individual completed the criminal background check in compliance with the State Board of Education (SBEC) rules. This would require the superintendent to certify to the Board of Trustees that the individual has undergone a criminal history background check and is capable of proper classroom management. In addition, the individual would be required to obtain classroom management training. The issued innovation permit would only be valid in the Como-Pickton CISD.

       " '|25.0811 states that a school district may not begin instruction before the fourth Monday of August. The TEC also states in 25.0812 that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. These requirements were based on the lobbying efforts of the business and tourism industries. These statutes do not take into account the wishes of the local school board nor more importantly, the needs of students. The current statutes create two problems for our students. The first is that the fall and the spring semester are of unequal lengths. Currently the fall semester has 80 days and the spring semester has 95 days. This imbalance of days per semester creates problems with semester final exams, STAAR/EOC preparation, and dual credit class planning. Local Innovation CISD will begin the school year as early as the second Monday in August. The reasons for this innovation are that the number of days in each semester will be equal, solving the current problems of semester final exam administration, STAAR/EOC preparation, and dual credit class planning. Additionally, CISD will also end the school year no earlier than the third week of May, once all state STAAR/EOC testing is completed. This will aid in the balancing of the semesters and allow the District to be more aligned with our dual credit class schedules. Local Innovation #2 Length of the School Day Currently the Texas Education Code states that a complete instructional day must contain at least 420 minutes. By providing an instructional day with 420 minutes, a district is able to provide 180 days of instruction and comply with statutory requirement of 75,600 minutes of instruction for the school year. Local Innovation CISD will provide an instructional day in excess of the 420 minutes as required by law. This innovation will allow us to have fewer instructional days while still complying with mandate that an instructional year has to contain at least 75,600 minutes. This innovation will allow the district the ability to balance the school days per semester. It will also allow the ability to bank minutes for early release days and will provide greater flexibility should school need to be cancelled for excessive absenteeism due to illness. An additional positive result of increasing the length of the school day, and therefore reducing the number of days in class, is that there will be a reduction in the district’s electricity costs due to decreased lighting and air conditioning/heating use. Local Innovation #3 Teacher Certification 1. Currently teachers are only able to teach classes in their areas of certification.

Beginning the school year earlier may also incur the following advantages: ● More instructional days in advance of standardized assessments, such as Advanced Placement and STAAR exams; ● Additional instructional time after the last official day of school for students retaking a STAAR exam over the summer; ● Completion of fall semester exams before dismissing for Winter Break; ● Opportunity for students to take advantage of the full array of summer dual-credit offerings at institutions of higher education; and ● More balanced distribution of instructional time for one-semester coursework, as students who currently take a one-semester course in the fall have fewer instructional days to master course content than students who take the same one-semester course in the spring. Implementation Guidance When planning the student and staff calendars, the District shall ensure the following: ● Changes to the student and staff calendars specified in this proposal must not go into effect until the 2018-19 school year. 5 ● Upon adoption of the Local Innovation Plan, the public must be notified that the school year may start earlier than the fourth Monday in August in the following school year. ● Winter Break should serve as the midpoint of the school year. ● Adjustments to the student and staff calendars must be budget-neutral.

These requirements placed upon schools are greatly based on the lobbying conducted on behalf of the business and tourism industries. These statute requirements do not take into considerations of local education agencies and even more importantly, the needs of students. As such, DISD seeks relief from Texas Education Code Section 25.0811 dictating that schools must not start prior to the 4th Monday in August.

The primary goals of this change will be to better balance the days of instruction in each semester, afford greater flexibility in calendar options, and better align the district’s calendar with the junior college in order to accommodate dual-credit courses.

Proposed DISD will start class no earlier than the third Monday in August, and will plan to end earlier in the spring semester in order to better balance the days in the fall and spring semesters, and to provide more educational days prior to scheduled state assessments. The primary goals of this change are to create greater flexibility in the District Calendar and to improve the overall district attendance rate, to improve student success on state and local assessments, and to allow for greater opportunity for meaningful staff development throughout the school year. Length of School Day Dew ISD Board Policy: EC (Legal) (Local) Current Law: TEC 25.081(e) State law currently requires that all school days must be 420 minutes long each day in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purposes, and to accumulate instructional minutes towards the 75,600 minutes required annually. Proposed Exemption from the 420-minute day requirement would allow DISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule on selected days whenever it was locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. While there is already a waiver process available to request exemption from this requirement, the waiver is limited to a 6-day maximum number for the school year. Exempting completely from the 420-minute requirement would give the DEW Independent School District District of Innovation Plan\\u200b district a significant amount of local control over scheduling (above and beyond the 6- day maximum as needed) without the fear of diminishing state funding or losing credit for instructional time that might cause the district to fall out of compliance with annual minute requirements. DISD does not intend to shorten the school day on a regular basis, or without specific purpose. To the greatest extent possible, “early release” days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees and published/distributed to district stakeholders in advance of the school year. The district would not schedule early release days under this exemption that were shorter than 240 minutes (4 hours). Teacher Contract Days Dew ISD Board Policy: DC (Legal) Current Law: TEC',\n",

By having them in school sooner, there routine is more established and our school transportation is able to get them to and from home as part of their school day. It also gives us an opportunity to feed children breakfast and lunch, when they may not otherwise have it at home.

The flexibility of the school start date allows local control, on an annual basis, to structure a calendar that best serves the needs of students, provides time for professional development and collaboration, and considers the effects of the school calendar on the school district community. Local Innovation Strategies: 1. The school district will determine on an annual basis the local student start date for the school year. 2. The school district can give greater consideration to starting school with a short week to ease the transition for students entering elementary, middle, and high school and to scheduling professional development opportunities and training for staff. 3. Flexibility in the school start date for students will allow a greater balance in instructional time for the first and second semester thus allowing teachers to better pace and deliver instruction each semester. 4. Local control of the school calendar gives the district greater flexibility and more opportunity for innovative strategies in establishing staff development for regular, ongoing support throughout the school year. 5. The school district will study attendance patterns to determine the placement of school holidays as indicated by the school community. The goal is to improve student attendance and academic success through flexibility in the calendar. 6. A flexible start date will be more conducive to accommodate the timeline for students who enroll in dual credit or college classes the fall, spring, and summer semesters. 6 CLASS SIZE / NOTICE OF CLASS SIZE (TEC Sec.',\n",

Proposed Innovation and Benefits of Exemptions: The Fort Bend ISD goal states that FBISD will provide an educational system that will enable all students to reach their full potential. By eliminating the calendar restrictions imposed by §§25.0811 and 25.0812, the District will improve student learning by providing flexibility to balance the days between the first and second semesters of school. With more balanced semesters in place, teachers will have a supportive climate to pace instruction and more adequate time for students who take a course in either the fall or spring semester. In addition, having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier would allow high school seniors the opportunity to enroll in college summer school classes, thereby supporting the District’s goal of promoting College and Career readiness. The ability for students to begin the school year earlier would allow the District the possibility of offering transition grades (pre-K/Kinder, 6th, and 9th) an earlier start time for an orientation designed to help the students acclimate, socially and emotionally, to their new campus environments. This reinforces the District’s goal of establishing an active learning community. Finally, the flexibility of the start and end dates of instruction would assist in attaining the District's goal of student success by developing staff and providing effective teachers who inspire learning. Flexibility in the calendar would allow professional development days to be distributed throughout the school year, rather than grouped together at the beginning or end of the school year. This flexibility would also allow for the possibility of teacher workdays near the end of each grading period. This work day could be utilized by staff for tasks such as finalizing grades, analyzing class data, completing report cards, conferencing with parents, and planning for improvements in teaching and learning. Ultimately, this opportunity for more thorough processing will benefit students by increasing communication between teachers, parents, and students. Current Status: Texas Education Code §§25.082(a) and 25.081(e) define a school day as “at least seven hours” and “420 minutes of instruction.” Proposed Innovation and Benefits of Exemption: The District’s goals state that our students should learn in a supportive climate. A rigid seven-hour day does not allow the District to structure its calendar to address differing needs of the student population. In order to achieve the flexibility to compile a responsive, supportive school calendar, we request an exemption from Texas Education Code §§25.082(a) and 25.081(e), which define the school day as seven hours or 420 minutes, respectively. This exemption will also provide the District flexibility and local control over the school calendar in order to better meet the needs and desires of the Fort Bend ISD community and District staff. In order to maximize available funding under the Foundation 7 School Program, the District will comply with 25.081(a)-(d), requiring provision of at least 75,600 minutes of student instruction (including intermissions and recesses) each school year.

       " '|25.0811 (a), Except as provided by this section, a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. (EB LEGAL Policy) Plan Rationale - When the state moved from mandating the number of days of instruction to a number of minutes, FWISD took the opportunity to revisit the school calendar and to look at what would be best for students and staff in achieving the goals of the District. This resulted in a calendar that allowed for a more targeted approach to professional learning and provided for strategic breaks for staff and students that is believed to help with the overall well-being of both, while also providing for extended family time throughout the year. In addition, this calendar allowed FWISD to balance the days in each semester which is best for students and teachers, particularly at the secondary level when participating in a one-semester course, and in all courses relative to the pacing of lessons and learning. This all worked because the school year started on August 22, which was the fourth Monday in 2016. In 2017, the fourth Monday is August 28. A school year beginning on August 28 results in the school year ending on June 8. This late ending negatively impacts additional opportunities for students in relation to summer school at the high school and college levels and for other camps and enrichment programs. It also impacts job opportunities for students. This is beyond the concerns related to the District’s inability to provide the other benefits of the calendar as outlined above. Local Innovation Plan Guideline - The first day of instruction in FWISD will not begin prior to the 15th of August, but will be scheduled to best meet the needs of FWISD, and its students, staff, and community in furthering the educational program. The development of the calendar will be developed through the District Calendar Committee and reviewed by the District Advisory Committee (DAC), the District Employee Relations Council (DERC), and other stakeholder groups. It is noted that through the annual review process, further innovations and exemptions may be needed to advance the work of the District in meeting the needs of students, and amendments may be necessary. As other districts across the state pursue this process and implement plans through this provision for additional flexibilities and more local control, new ideas for innovation may emerge that have great applicability in FWISD. We hope that through the natural course of having more autonomy and freedom to think innovatively that all students across the state will be able to take advantage of these key learnings.

       " '|25.0811 (a), Except as provided by this section, a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. (EB Legal Policy) Plan Rationale – When the state moved from mandating the number of days of instruction to a number of minutes, Frisco ISD took the opportunity to revisit the school calendar and to look at what would be best for students and staff in achieving the goals of the District. This resulted in a calendar that allowed for a more targeted approach to professional learning prior to the start of school and throughout the year, and provided for strategic breaks for staff and students that is believed to help with the overall well-being of both, while also providing for extended family time throughout the year. These job-embedded opportunities for growth and collaboration keep professional learning meaningful and timely and reduce the number of summer workshops and the need for substitutes, which 4LOCAL INNOVATION PLAN 2017 also reduces spending. This calendar also allowed for more dedicated teacher work-day time that helps with teacher stress and morale. In addition, this calendar allowed FISD to balance the days in each semester which is best for students and teachers, particularly at the secondary level when participating in a one-semester course, and in all courses relative to the pacing of lessons and learning. This all worked because the school year started on August 22, which was the fourth Monday in 2016. In 2017, the fourth Monday is August 28. A school year beginning on August 28 results in the school year ending on June 8.This late ending negatively impacts additional opportunities for students in relation to summer school at the high school and college levels and for other camps and enrichment programs. It also impacts job opportunities for students. This is beyond the concerns related to the District’s inability to provide the other benefits of the calendar as outlined above. Prior to the mandate in 2007 through TEC 25.0811 (a), school started in FISD on the second or third Monday. Since the 2000-2001 school year, the earliest school has started in FISD is August 13, which was a second Monday. This mandate does not allow for a waiver request. Local Innovation Plan Guideline – The first day of instruction in FISD will not begin prior to the second Monday in August, but will be scheduled to best meet the needs of FISD, and its students, staff and community in furthering the educational program.

       " '|25.0811 EB (Legal) Rationale: Relief from this statute could potentially allow the following: *First semester complete before Winter Break; instructional pacing is more beneficial *More instructional days before State Assessments; flexibility for different types of learners and learning needs *More professional development opportunities during the school year for teachers *Full days for professional development opportunities as opposed to half days *Flexibility the first week of school - Students may not have a full week *The calendar could be more aligned with college schedules, providing our students with additional opportunities *Cost of starting school early (e.g. cooling cost in August) should be considered *All Administrative regulations and policies would be followed in relation to extreme heat during recess. *Adjustments to professional development calendar would need to be addressed *Start date should be no earlier than August 15th and preferably no earlier than the third week of August *Preference that student snot have a full week the first week of school Innovation: TEC Ch. 12A.003(b)(1)(B) Modifications to the school day or year The current law that prohibits the district from starting school before the third Monday of August forces the district into a calendar that has minimal opportunity for teacher professional development, requires the semester to end after the winter break, and provides negligible time for summer school before state mandated assessment re-takes in the summer. Starting school even one week earlier can help minimize the negative impacts the district sees in these areas. Starting early will allow for creative scheduling that allows for more intentional teacher professional development throughout the school year and also allows students to have a schedule that is more conducive to their learning. Rationale: By exempting the District from this law, the District: *will have the flexibility of hiring a probationary teacher for a second year to provide form more growth and coaching when the teacher is hired under the 5 of 8 rule. Innovation: TEC Ch.12A.003(b)(1)(E) any other innovations prescribed by the Board of Trustees Exemption from this requirement will provide campus administrators and hiring officials with the time needed to fully assess and support a teacher before making decisions regarding moving the employee from a probationary contract when that employee has only been with the district one year.

       " '|25.0811) Current Statue: Students may not begin school before the 4th Monday of August. In the past, districts could apply for a waiver to start the school calendar earlier to meet the needs of the local community. This waiver opportunity was met with resistance from the Texas tourism groups who lobbied to have the practice ended, because they believed it was detrimental to the Texas tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. Proposed flexibility: This flexibility of start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the campus, students and local community. Flexibility to start earlier in August would help our district plan for balanced instructional time in the semesters that would support semester course curriculum. In addition, flexibility in the start and end of the school year would allow students to enroll in college courses that begin in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness.

Learners require customized, well-designed educational experience that develop their unique interests and talents to create a passion for learning. • It is our responsibility to prepare students for their future.

Historically, the preference has been for the calendar to be set for the first semester to be completed prior to the Christmas break. It is desirable for the fall and spring semesters to be as equal in length as possible, allowing semester-long or one-half credit courses to have ample time for students to master the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. Without the ability to start school earlier than allowable by law, the public school year often overlaps with the beginning of the college summer session. Students desiring to enroll in summer college courses, which begin in early June, would have that ability. Maximizing instructional time prior to state assessments, allocating time for appropriate planning, and managing student focus and behavior are each affected by the school calendar.

Beginning school prior to the fourth Monday enables our district more flexibility in beginning and meeting needs of young learners and ending the first semester prior to the mid-term. Having the flexibility to start school mid-week on years when this option supports first semester completion is an important consideration as young learners adjust to full weeks in class after the Summer. Ending the semester is a priority due to best practice in student services culminating finals and mid-term benchmarks prior to a major holiday. Additionally, students new to the district or in need of relocation to another district are able to start a fresh semester after Winter break. Further a priority is to create the time by adjusting scheduling to end the second semester by the end of May. Senior students attending higher education require time to settle in and begin their classes prior to Summer course work in community college or the university. Finally, beginning at a point prior to the fourth Monday in August allows the district greater ability to plan for the required minutes of instruction to fall within a time frame effective for professional development.

       " '|25.0811 inhibits these goals by prohibiting the District from beginning instruction before the 4th Monday in August. Flexibility to begin instruction earlier in the calendar year will enable the District to improve quality instruction by balancing the amount of instructional time in the semesters allowing teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after the winter break. This change will also afford more time to teaching semester courses at the secondary level. In addition, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses and/or trade school courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. This flexibility would also allow the school year to end prior to June 1st which would allow for a longer summer school session for those students needing accelerated instruction prior to the third administration of STAAR and more instructional time for students seeking credit recovery in the summer. Finally, adjusting the start date will afford additional instruction days prior to Spring Assessments such as: • State Mandated Testing • Dual Credit Finals Student/Teacher Ratios; Class Size Currently: A 22 to 1 student/teacher ratio is required by State law for Kindergarten to 4th grade classes. When a class exceeds this limit, the district must complete and file a waiver with the Texas Education Agency, and the district must notify parents of waivers to class size limits. Proposed: While the District intends to keep a 22 to 1 ratio for class size at the Elementary level, a class size waiver to TEA has been required. Based on our observations, we believe that a local solution to class size adjustments should be made without submitting waivers to TEA. Goodrich ISD will continuously monitor enrollment at the Elementary campus. In the event a class size exceeds the 22 to 1 ratio, a waiver will not be submitted; however, the Superintendent will provide the Board of Trustees with updated enrollment numbers and a plan of action to reduce class size. Teacher Certification Current: In the event a certified teacher cannot be hired for a position or a teacher is assigned to a subject outside his/her certification, the district must submit an emergency certification/exception/waiver to TEA. Proposed: The District will maintain its current expectation for employee certification and will make every attempt to hire individuals with appropriate certifications for the vacant position. Many of the career pathways set forth by HB 5 require very specialized certification. The current laws limit the District’s ability to hire teachers for hard‐to‐fill, high‐demand career and technical courses when quality certified teachers are not available. Goodrich ISD principals will submit a written request for approval to fill a teaching position to the Superintendent or designee: 1.

For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. The Texas tourism groups lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting their tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. The current process allows no flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Innovation Strategies: This exemption will allow the GISD the flexibility to make a local decision annually regarding the year start date that best meets the needs of the students and local community. This empowers us to personalize learning, increase college and career readiness, and balance the amount of instructional time per semester. In addition, by having the flexibility in the start and end of the school year, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. Removing the uniform start date could also let the GISD start classes as a short week, easing the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. This will also allow for more flexible professional development opportunities for our staff. GISD will not start school prior the 2nd Monday of August.

By adjusting the calendar, Granbury ISD will eliminate the imbalanced six-week and semester schedules. GISD will align our calendars with Weatherford College, Advanced Placement Exams, and STAAR/EOC timelines.

TEC §25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15. Proposal: To best serve the students of Grandview ISD, we propose to create a school calendar which serves the needs of our local community. We propose moving the mandatory start date earlier than the fourth Monday. Waiting to start classes until the fourth Monday in August forces semesters to be significantly unequal in length, with second semester being approximately four weeks longer than the first semester. Flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable our district to better balance instruction time in each semester as well as making an effort to end our first semester prior to Winter Break. 2. Exemptions from Future TEC Mandates To best serve our local Grandview ISD community, staff, and students, Grandview ISD includes a provision in our Local Innovation Plan for the District to maintain control over any future, eligible Texas Education Code mandates, which may be exempted by a two thirds majority vote of the Grandview ISD Board of Trustees.

       " '|25.0811 First day of instruction (a) “Except as provided by this section, a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August.” Rationale This law restricts the District from having the flexibility to design its calendar to best meet the needs of its students, staff and community. Because the community expects the fall semester to end with final exams before the Winter Break, the restricted start date creates a significant imbalance in the number of instructional days in each semester. By 3/23/2017 starting earlier, not only will there be greater balance, particularly important in semester- long courses, but it will allow more instructional days prior to state testing dates. This exemption could also result in an earlier end date, closer to the Memorial Day holiday, which is also an expressed preference of the community. Finishing school closer to the Memorial Day holiday will better allow students to enroll in summer school classes within the district as well as institutions of higher learning. Local Innovation Plan With input from staff and community stakeholders, the District Calendar Committee will develop its annual calendar recommendation for approval by the Board of Trustees. Through the exemption, the first day of instruction can begin prior to the fourth Monday in August. Preference will be given to starting instruction around the third week in August with assurances to the community that it will not begin prior to the second Monday in August. B.

This forces the district into a calendar that has minimal opportunity for teacher professional development, causes shortened grading periods when the first semester ends in December, and provides negligible times for summer school before state mandated assessment re-takes in the summer. Proposed Innovation: To best serve the students in Hitchcock ISD, we will move the school start date for students to no earlier than the second week in August. Starting earlier will allow for creative scheduling that allows for more intentional teacher professional development throughout the school year and also allows students to have a schedule that is more conducive to their learning.

Rationale for the Exemption: • Restricting school start date to the 4th Monday in August operationally challenges HEB ISD because the 75,600 instructional minutes must be calendared between the 4th Monday in August and generally May 28 due to constraints of the venue contract for HS graduation. Flexibility to the start date would allow the district to address the following issues caused by the current calendar constraints: 1. Increased student regression due to longer summer break. 2. Lack of flexibility to schedule student breaks or other options during the school year. 3. Condensed employee work schedules limiting flexibility to schedule holidays, personal days and professional development days impacting employee work / life balance. 4. Increased teacher absences and related substitute teacher expense. 5. A lack of true choice for the Calendar Committee in development of the school calendar.

Proposed Iola ISD would like to exempt TEC 25.0811, thus allowing us to start school prior to the fourth Monday of August. Iola ISD would not start school before the third Monday of August and teachers would not have to report before the second Monday of August. How does this benefit Iola ISD Children? Starting one week earlier adds more instructional days prior to state testing in the spring. It balances the fall and spring semester minutes and allows periodic breaks throughout the school year. It ensures the school year will end before the Grimes County Fair in June. It also allows our calendar to better align with local colleges so our graduating class has time to prepare for their upcoming summer college courses. Professional development for teachers throughout the school year can be focused directly on what the students need at that point in time. How does this benefit Iola ISD Teachers? Professional development will be spread throughout the year, rather than having all of it before school starts. This way, professional development can be designed to meet the needs of teachers at various points during the year.

Innovation: Allows Joshua ISD to begin school earlier than fourth Monday in August. Class Size and Notice of Class Size The Texas Education Code currently prohibits a school district from enrolling more than 22 students in a kindergarten - fourth grade class. When circumstances require this limit to be exceeded, districts must apply to the Commissioner of Education for a waiver and follow a specific procedure to provide notification to the parent of each student affected by the exception. Local control of the maximum enrollment for kindergarten-fourth grade classes and the procedure for notifying parents of exceptions to the District determined class size would benefit students and the District by minimizing disruptions to established classes, reducing administrative costs associated with the waiver and notification process and providing flexibility to adjust the maximum class size when it is determined to be in the best interests of the students. The District seeks local control to implement innovations in the following areas for student/teacher ratios. Joshua ISD will determine the maximum class size for each grade level. Joshua ISD will develop procedures for determining when to add a teacher to a kindergarten – fourth grade when enrollment exceeds the locally developed class size limitation. This procedure will focus on student success. Joshua ISD will develop a local letter to notify parents when class size exceeds the district determined maximum number of students.

However, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. • TEC §25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. Proposal: The district will develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in KCISD by incorporating the flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, and a school end date prior to June. By ending the school year earlier, KCISD can support students who need remediation, as well as students who are entering college or trade school. An earlier school start date allows these students to register for summer classes and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time. _____________________________________________________ 2. Teacher Certification Requirements Exemption from: TEC §21.003(a) TEC§21.053 Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: • TEC §21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher or other certified position unless the person holds an appropriate certificate. • TEC §21.053(b) states that an educator may not be paid for teaching or work done before the issuance of a valid certificate. Proposal: The district will maintain its current expectations for employee certification and will make every attempt to hire individuals with appropriate certifications for the position in question. When that is not reasonably possible, the district will have the flexibility to hire individuals who are knowledgeable in the area and equipped to effectively perform the duties of the position in question. Karnes City ISD would like the ability to locally certify teachers in areas of high demand, to better meet the educational needs of our students. These areas would include, but are not limited to, CTE and languages other than English. Special Education teachers will continue to be required to hold a standard teaching certificate. Teachers with industry certifications and native speakers with qualified experience could be eligible to teach a course through a local teaching certification. Additionally, Karnes City ISD will notify parents if a locally certified teacher is employed for their child’s class. This process will allow more flexibility in our scheduling, and provide more options for our students in class offerings leading to industry recognized certifications. ______________________________________________________ 3.

A school district may: (1) begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August if the district operates a year-round system under Section|25.0811 inhibits Katy ISD’s ability to establish an instructional calendar that best meets the instructional needs of students and the priorities of the community by prohibiting the District from beginning instruction before the fourth Monday in August. The fourth Monday in August is an arbitrary start date that does not meet the needs of the Katy ISD community. The District has historically ended classes for the first semester before the Winter Break to better align with college and university schedules in the area and to best accommodate high school students taking dual credit courses. Benefit of Exemption: Having the flexibility to establish an earlier start date will enable the District to better balance the amount of instructional time available in each semester, providing classroom teachers the opportunity to deliver more equitable learning experiences for students in the fall and spring semesters. Waiver of the required school start date will allow time at the conclusion of the school calendar for instruction prior to summer administration of state assessments required for graduation. Finally, it will also enable the District to give a full week off at Thanksgiving to alleviate the loss of funding due to student absenteeism. There are 42 different countries and 91 languages represented in Katy ISD’s student population. Many of these parents and others often take their children out of school the full week of Thanksgiving and before the end of the school year in June in order to visit family members in other states and/or to take long trips to their home countries. Besides the loss of instructional time, student absences result in a significant loss of ADA funding ($126,000 for the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving break and additional funds for instructional days at the end of the 2015-2016 school year) that could be used to support the attainment of the District’s mission and vision. http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25.084 Katy Independent School District Local Innovation Plan By having the flexibility to end school earlier, parents will be less likely to take their children out of school prior to the last day of instruction. Graduating seniors will also be able to enroll in college courses that normally begin the first week of June to further their college and career readiness. Likewise, teachers who wish to pursue advanced college degrees or additional certifications will complete the school year in time to attend summer classes. Local Guidelines: The Katy Improvement Council, comprised of teachers, administrators, support personnel, parents, and business and community leaders, serves as the District’s calendar committee. This Council will develop several instructional calendar options and recommend a preferred option for Board consideration. In developing calendar options, KIC will utilize the flexibility of having more local contract on the school start date. Exemption from the Texas Education Code Section §',\n",

       " '|25.0811 and 25.0812 EB (Legal) Rationale: Relief from this statute could potentially allow the following: • First semester complete before Winter Break; instructional pacing is more beneficial • More instructional days before State Assessments; flexibility for different types of learners and learning needs • More professional development opportunities during the school year for teachers • Full days for professional development opportunities as opposed to half days • Flexibility the first week of school – Students would not have a full week • The calendar could be more aligned with college schedules, providing our students with additional opportunities While the District seeks freedom from this law, the following should be considered: \\uf0b7 Cost of starting early (e.g. cooling cost in August) should be considered \\uf0b7 All Administrative Regulations and policies would be followed in relation to extreme heat during recess. \\uf0b7 Adjustments to professional development calendar will need to be addressed. \\uf0b7 Start date should be no earlier than August 15th and preferably no earlier than the third week of August. \\uf0b7 Prefer that students not have a full week the first week of school Innovation: TEC Ch. 12A.003(b)(1)(B) Modifications to the school day or year The current law that prohibits the district from starting school before the third Monday of August forces the district into a calendar that has minimal opportunity for teacher professional development, requires the semester to end after the winter break, and provides negligible time for summer school before state mandated assessment re-takes in the summer. Starting school even one week earlier can help minimize the negative impacts the district sees in these area. Starting early will allow for creative scheduling that allows for more intentional teacher professional development throughout the school year and also allows students to have a schedule that is more conducive to their learning.

A school district may: (1) begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August if the district operates a year-round system under Section|25.0811 inhibits La Porte ISD’s ability to establish an instructional calendar that best meets the instructional needs of students and the priorities of the community by prohibiting the District from beginning instruction before the fourth Monday in August. The fourth Monday in August is an arbitrary start date that does not meet the needs of the La Porte ISD community. The District has historically ended classes for the first semester before the Winter Break to better align with college and university schedules in the area and to best accommodate high school students taking dual credit courses. Benefit of Exemption: Having the flexibility to establish an earlier start date will enable the District to better balance the amount of instructional time available in each semester, providing classroom teachers the opportunity to deliver more equitable learning experiences for students in the fall and spring semesters. Waiver of the required school start date will allow time at the conclusion of the school calendar for instruction prior to summer administration of state assessments required for graduation. Finally, it will also enable the District to give a full week off at Thanksgiving to alleviate the loss of funding due to student absenteeism.

Graduating seniors will also be able to enroll in college courses that normally begin the first week of June to further their college and career readiness. Likewise, teachers who wish to pursue advanced college degrees or additional certifications will complete the school year in time to attend summer classes. Local Guidelines: The La Porte ISD DEIC, comprised of teachers, administrators, support personnel, parents, business and community leaders, serves as the District’s calendar committee. This Council will develop several instructional calendar options and recommend a preferred option for Board consideration.

Sec. 25.0812 states a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. The current process allows no flexibility in the design of school calendars to fit the need of the community of the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in the matter. Previously, districts had the option of applying to TEA for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. The Texas tourism groups lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting their tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. Proposed Innovation Plan: Relief from Sec.|25.0811 will allow La Vega ISD to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. Altered school start dates allow Early College High School students and dual credit students to have calendars that match the institutions of higher education and provide for increased local control of the instructional calendar in order to be responsive to community needs and align with local universities, college entrance exams, and STAAR timelines. This empowers LVISD to personalize learning, increase college and career readiness, and balance the amount of instructional time in each semester.

       " '|25.0811 (EB LEGAL) First Day of Instruction- States that a School District may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. i. Innovation Strategy 1. Flexible Calendar – Lackland ISD will begin instruction no earlier than the 2nd Monday of August in an effort to create greater flexibility in the school calendar. Although military-related transitions are unpredictable, there is a pattern of transitions that occur in alignment with winter break. Due to this pattern of transitions, it has been our practice, based on community input, to complete first-semester course offerings prior to the beginning of winter break. This practice allows military-connected students a concurrent transition with their military member having completed course assignments for final grading. This practice also supports Lackland ISD’s ability to reduce stressors related to grades and course completion, a strong contribution to positive social–emotional growth. 2. Balanced Semesters – In an effort to support student ability to complete course work prior to transitions that occur in conjunction with winter break, the fall semester has significantly fewer days than the spring semester. Flexible start dates allow the District to ensure that fall semester courses have the same opportunity to provide curricular depth and complexity as provided in the spring semester. 3. Participation in College Courses – By having flexibility in the start and end of the school year, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. There is also a greater opportunity for students to take dual credit courses that match a college academic calendar. ii. Local Guidelines: 1. The District Calendar Committee will receive staff and community input to build the school calendar. 2. The draft calendar will be posted for additional feedback. 3. The District Calendar Committee will consider feedback and recommend a school calendar for Board approval. 4. The recommended school calendar is subject to Board approval. b. § 25.082 (a) and § 25.081(e) Seven Hour School Day – define a school day as “at least seven hours” and “420 minutes of instruction.” i. Innovation Strategy 1. Lackland ISD believes that the professional learning of its teachers and staff is paramount to increasing student achievement and maintaining a positive climate for social development. An exemption from the 7 hour / 420-minute day statute would allow the addition of early release days in our District calendar to utilize for parent conferences, analyzing class data, completing report cards, staff participation in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), and final exams. This opportunity for more thorough processing will benefit students by increasing communication between teachers, parents, and students. 2.

       " '|25.0811 Benefit of Exemption Beginning school earlier than the fourth Monday in August will reduce summer regression in learning by shortening the time for students to be out of school during the summer months, which will provide true continuous learning and maximize student performance. Additionally, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses or college camps that start early in June. School start date is an item that the District should be able to determine locally and on an annual basis to determine what is best for our community. Innovation Strategy Lago Vista ISD will determine on an annual basis the local starting date of the first semester, not to precede the second Monday in August of any year. The superintendent will submit the annual calendar to the Board of Trustees for approval. The ability to modify the start date of school allows the District the flexibility to balance semester days, align classes to college courses, and ease transitions by beginning school on a shortened week. Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs. Lago Vista ISD will continue to comply with the UIL calendar for commencement of summer practices. The District may not schedule the last day of school for students for a school year before May 15.

Partner with and involve our diverse community to support LDISD students and staff. Flexibility with regard to school start date allows a start date that best meets the needs of the local community and its students. It also allows the district to more closely align its calendar with that of local partners such as community colleges, universities, technology training centers, and neighboring school districts. These partners provide a multitude of educational opportunities for the students of LDISD. For students in those programs, alignment allows a more consistent, meaningful experience. Additionally, flexibility with regard to school start date allows opportunities for students to obtain official transcripts, thereby enabling enrollment in summer courses offered by local partners. 2. Provide the consistent delivery of an innovative curriculum that: individualizes instruction, motivates and meets the needs of all students, addresses varied learning styles, and strives toward the highest standard as measured by the Texas Education Agency. Flexibility with regard to school start date allows a more balanced instructional calendar. Increased balance results in increased consistency in the delivery of instruction. The pacing, breadth, and depth of course content can better meet the needs of students and maximize learning. Students will have more instruction prior to state- mandated assessments. Additionally, flexibility with regard to school start date allows more opportunities to create options for students in need of additional support. This increases the opportunity for individualized instruction that meets the needs of all students.

Connection to Vision 2020 Strategic Plan: From Strategy 2B: Create trainings that enhance the connections between instructional initiatives in the District for all stakeholders. From Strategy 7E: Expand professional development offerings to include data driven analysis techniques Benefit to District: The number of days in the fall and spring semesters will be more balanced than they are currently. Additionally, Lancaster ISD classes can begin prior to the start of Cedar Valley College classes. The balanced semesters will align with college semesters, allowing more opportunities for summer school, internships and industrial certification opportunities. Lancaster ISD will also utilize strategically planned dates to empower, educate and encourage families to embrace involvement in education through conference and workshop opportunities. Benefit to Student Achievement: 1. Increase professional development days for all teachers during the calendar year 2. Increase the number of content specific days for educators from 10 to 24 3. Increase student achievement as measured by advanced courses Example in Practice: The student start date would move back one week allowing us to develop a more responsive professional development plan that will afford us the opportunity to embed more professional learning opportunities during the school year. In addition, we will build time into the calendar for activities such as data disaggregation, teacher collaboration, student engagement and community service for students and teachers.

       " '|25.0811) Currently: Students may not begin school before the 4th Monday of August. Proposed: To allow for a calendar that fits the local needs of our community, we would like to consider a flexible calendar option which may include an early start date. Students may begin earlier than the fourth Monday of August. This earlier start date will allow for a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, and a school end date prior to June. By ending earlier, LISD can support students who need intervention prior to the third administration of the STAAR or credit recovery, as well as students who are entering college or technical school. The earlier start date will allow for coordination between all extra-curricular school events, dual credit classes, and allowing for flexibility with professional development days throughout the school year.

       " \"|25.0811, a district may not start instruction prior to the fourth Monday in August. The Innovation Committee was formed on December 12, 2017 and is comprised of the Chief of Staff and fourteen members of the Districtwide Education Improvement Council (DWEIC). The fourteen members from DWEIC were randomly selected from volunteers to fill seven staff vacancies and seven parent/community member vacancies. Innovation Committee Members: Matt Smith, Chief of Staff Angela Haas, Wiley Middle School Jessy Hanshaw, Running Brushy Middle School Monette McIver, Community Representative David Morgan, Parent Representative Amber Patrick, Reagan Elementary Catherine Robinson, Steiner Ranch Elementary Amber Ryder, Parent Representative Chris Simpson, Leander High School John Tomaszewski, Parent Representative Susan Whisenant, Parent Representative James Williams, Community Representative Amanda Willim, Reed Elementary Sylvia Wood, Rouse High School Mei Xu, Parent Representative Innovations - First Day of Instruction Leander ISD proposes flexibility with its calendar, including exemption from TEC 25.0811. Several years ago, the Texas Legislature required that school start no earlier than the fourth Monday in August. This state law resulted in an imbalance in the school calendar, with the fall semester significantly shorter than the spring semester. The state mandated start of school also pushed graduation later, limiting student opportunities to enroll in local summer college courses due to the overlap of the LISD school year with the summer calendar of local colleges. LISD Innovation Plan Given the challenge with \\u200bTEC 25.0811 - First Day of Instruction\\u200b, the Innovation Committee recommends the development of an academic calendar that allows for instruction to begin prior to the fourth Monday of August. This flexibility would allow LISD to: 1. Develop the academic calendar to help achieve the LISD Vision and Goals. 2. Balance semesters more evenly and expand college and career learning opportunities. 3. Ensure the academic calendar allows for quality professional learning opportunities for teachers and staff. Potential Benefits from LISD Innovation Plan Students: A better balance of instructional days in the semesters may aid students in terms of subject knowledge and retention. In addition, students taking college level courses such as dual enrollment, Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) classes may have additional time in the curriculum, thus increasing their chances to earn college credits. Beginning the school year earlier may also enable high school students the opportunity to pursue additional college courses immediately after the LISD academic year ends. Staff: By improving the balance of semesters, teachers have a better opportunity to ensure students are mastering key concepts necessary in the grading periods for students. This allows LISD to examine the placement of strategic professional learning opportunities for staff. Families: Through the LISD Innovation Plan, the Board of Trustees has more local control of the academic calendar. This allows the Board of Trustees and LISD Administration to design a calendar that better reflects the desires of the LISD community. Term of Plan The Innovation Plan may have a term of up to five years beginning from the date of adoption unless terminated or amended earlier by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the law.

       " '|25.0811) State law currently prohibits school districts from starting class before the fourth Monday in August, unless they are year-round districts. Innovation Strategies The flexibility of the start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the need of the students, the school, and the community. In addition, this flexibility allows the district to better align its starting date to accommodate the start date of colleges in which the district uses for dual credit courses. Another benefit of exempting this restriction is it allows the school to look at starting classes as a short week which can ease the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. Additionally, the ability to change the school start date can also help to better balance the number of days in each semester. 2. Length of School Day (TEC§25.081) State law currently requires that all school days must be 7 hours long each day in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purposes and to accumulate instructional minutes towards the 75,600 minutes required annually. Innovation Strategies Exemption from the 7 hour/day requirement would allow Levelland ISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule on selected days whenever it was locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. While there is a waiver process available to request exemption from this requirement, the waiver is limited to a 6-day maximum number for the school year. Exempting completely from the 7 hour/day requirement would give the district a significant amount of local control over scheduling (above and beyond the 6-day maximum as needed) without the fear of diminishing state funding or losing credit for instructional time that might cause the district to fall out of compliance with annual minute requirements. This would allow the district the flexibility to schedule non-instructional days into the schedule to allow for teachers to analyze student data and engage in targeted, relevant professional development. Levelland ISD does not have any intentions to shorten the school day on a regular basis, or without a specific purpose. To the greatest extent possible, \"early release\" days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees and published and distributed to stakeholders in advance of the school year and continuously published using school media. (however, if the overall 75,600 minute requirement is not reached, funding will be reduced proportionally) 3. Teacher Certification(TEC§21.003) State law states that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board of Educator Certification. Innovation Strategies The current certification requirement severely limits the district\\'s options to hire professionals with work related experience or degrees to teach a variety of courses from CTE and STEM- related courses along with other required courses, such as fine arts, needed throughout the district. In order to maximize the opportunities for students to take such courses, the district will consider the qualifications necessary to create a local requirement for these courses instead of the requirements set forth in TEC 21.003(a). The exemption will allow the district to consider professionals, those with proven skills, and trade-related professionals to teach courses on a full-time or even part-time basis. The campus principal shall submit to the superintendent a request for local certification that will allow a certified or non-certified teacher to teach a subject(s) for which he/she is not certified. The principal must specify in writing the reason for the request and document what credentials the teacher possesses that would qualify this individual to teach the proposed subject. Background checks will be conducted and finger prints required. The superintendent will report this action to the Board of Trustees at the first board meeting following these assignments. A teacher certification waiver, state permit applications, or other paperwork will not be submitted to the Texas Education Agency. (although, please note that special education and bilingual teachers must continue to be certified) 4. Class Sizes and Student-Teacher Ratios (§',\n",
       " '|25.0811 and 25.0812 Law Advantages The Texas Education Code states a school district may not begin school before the fourth Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier. The vast majority of districts applied for the waiver and would begin the third Monday, some even going as early as the second Monday. The start-date waiver was eventually removed when legislature determined school districts should begin the first semester no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. The current process allows no flexibility in the design and balancing of instructional semesters to meet the needs of the students. Texas Education Code Section 25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. 1. Flexibility of start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. 2. Personalize learning, increase college and career readiness, and balance the amount of instructional time per semester.

This requirement inhibits the District’s flexibility to develop a calendar that best meets students’, staff, and community needs. Research has found that a catalyst to accelerating student learning and improving teacher practice is allowing for structured time for educators to prepare, lesson plan, and receive professional development. Other benefits of this flexibility include having balanced semesters that allow for finals prior to the Christmas break and for the completion of the K-12 school year that allows high school students the ability to attend summer college courses.

For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to begin school earlier. The waiver process was eliminated several years ago, mandating that all schools begin school no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. This requirement inhibits the District’s flexibility to develop a calendar that best meets students’, staff, and community needs. Research has found that a catalyst to accelerating student learning and improving teacher practice is allowing for structured time for educators to prepare, lesson plan, and receive professional development. Local Guidelines and Applicable Guidelines: Current statute prevents the District from designing calendars that best meet the needs of students. Having the flexibility to set the start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and our community. This empowers us to personalize and customize learning for all District learners, including teachers and staff through professional learning, and allows us to more efficiently balance the amount of instructional time per semester. In addition, by having the flexibility in the start and end of the school year, students and staff will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. Removing the constraints of the current uniform start date will allow Marble Falls ISD to implement a possible short first week, easing the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. This will ultimately allow for more flexible professional development opportunities and preparation time for our staff. The District, through the recommendation of the District Educational Improvement Committee (DEIC), will determine locally, on an annual basis, the upcoming school year calendar. The District, through the recommendation of the DEIC, will design and adopt a calendar with a school start date that begins no earlier than the second Monday of August and ends no later than the first full week of June. 7 Marble Falls ISD Local District of Innovation Plan – Approved Minimum Attendance for Class Credit or Final Grade Exemption from: §§ TEC|25.0811 – Instructional Calendar • TEC',\n",

       " '|25.0811) Current Law Students are prohibited from starting school before the 4th Monday of August. For many years, this was strictly a local decision. Districts had the option to apply for a waiver to start earlier, but the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exception. Charter schools are not subject to the 4th Monday of August requirement and may schedule an earlier first school day. Rationale for Exemption The flexibility of the start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students, the school, and the community. Benefits to this exemption include but are not limited to: • Aligning school start date to accommodate college start dates for dual credit students • Starting school mid-week in order to aid in the transition to school for students. This provides a natural break after establishing routines, procedures, and expectations before introducing rigorous academic based lessons for students transitioning to their respective campus. • Providing a better opportunity to balance the number of days in each semester. • Providing more instructional and accelerated instruction days prior to State mandated tests. • Providing ongoing professional development for staff. Currently we must have most of our professional development at the beginning of the school year with less time for ongoing training during the school year. Assurances May ISD will not start school prior to the second Monday in August 2. Length of School Day (25.082 Subsection A) Current Law State law currently requires that all school days must be 420 minutes (7 hours) long each day in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purpose, and to accumulate instructional minutes toward the 75,600 minutes required annually. Rationale for Exemption Exemption from the 420-minute (7 hours) day requirement would allow May ISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule on selected days, whenever locally determined necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. While there is a waiver process available to request exemption from this requirement, the waiver is limited to a 6-day maximum number for the school year. Exempting completely from 3 the 420-minute requirement would give the district a significant amount of local control over scheduling (above and beyond the 6-day maximum as needed) without the fear of diminishing state funding or losing credit for instructional time that might cause the district to fall out of compliance with annual minute requirements. This would allow the district the flexibility to schedule non-instructional days into the schedule to allow for our teachers to analyze student data and engage in targeted, relevant professional development. Benefits of this exemption would include but not be limited to: • Allowing flexibility to schedule “innovation” or “flex” days into the school calendar. Examples would include days for intensive accelerated instruction for identified students, preparation days for staff, data analysis days, ongoing professional development days for staff or a combination of each. • The District would be able to be more strategic in its approach to learning styles and learning environments. • More “out of the box” conversations among staff because restrictions have been lifted • More preparation time is a challenge for every teacher. Allowing teachers to more frequently “sharpen the axe before cutting the wood” might allow for more high quality lessons and improved classroom management. Assurances May ISD does not have any intentions to shorten the school day on a regular basis, or without specific purpose. To the greatest extent possible, “early release” days would be planned ahead of time and noted in the district calendar, which is approved by the Board of Trustees, published, and distributed to stakeholders in advance of the school year and continuously published using school media.

As such, MISD seeks relief from Texas Education Code Section 25.0811 dictating that schools must not start prior to the 4 th Monday in August. Additionally, MISD also seeks relief from Texas Education Code 25.0812 stipulating that the last day of instructions must not be set prior to May 15. Innovative Practice: MISD seeks local control over the start and end dates of a school year. The MISD anticipates starting school during the month of August and concluding the school year in May. The primary goals of this change will be to better balance the days of instruction in each semester, afford greater flexibility in calendar options, and better align the district’s calendar with the junior college in order to accommodate the Miami Early College High School. This will also allow time to provide student orientation time prior to the start of the college semester, eliminate inefficient time after the conclusion of the college semester, and allow break time prior to the start of summer school for all students.

In addition, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness.

       " '|25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August unless the district operates a year-round system. TEC §25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. Proposal: These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. The flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable the district to develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in New Boston ISD. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, and a school end date prior to June. By ending earlier, NBISD can support students who need remediation, as well as students who are entering college or trade school. An earlier school start date allows students to register for summer classes with finalized official transcripts and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time. Staff will also be able to attend summer school classes as well. Local Guidelines The district will determine, on an annual basis, when each school year will begin and end. 2. Teacher Contracts - TEC §21.102(b) states that a probationary contract may not be for a term exceeding one school year. The probationary contract may be renewed for two additional one-year periods, for a maximum permissible probationary contract period of three school years, except that the probationary period may not exceed one year for a person who has been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight years preceding employment by the district. Proposal: This limited time period is insufficient in some cases to fully determine the staff member’s effectiveness since teacher contract timelines demand that employment decisions must be made prior to the availability of end-of-year classroom and student data. . A waiver from this requirement will permit the District to issue a probationary contract for a period of up to two years for experienced teachers and counselors newly hired in New Boston ISD. Local Guidelines At the time of contract recommendation consideration, newly hired teachers and counselors with the district, who have been employed in public education for at least five of the eight previous years and have completed their first probationary year with the district, may receive a probationary contract for the second year in order to continue to evaluate the staff member’s effectiveness. 3. Teacher Certification Requirements - TEC §21.003(a) states that a person may not be employed as a teacher by a school district unless the person holds an appropriate certificate or permit issued by the appropriate state agency. In the event a district cannot locate a certified teacher for a position or a teacher is teaching a subject outside of their certification, the district must request emergency certification from the Texas Education Agency and/or State Board of Educator Certification. This system is burdensome and does not take into account the unique financial and/or instructional needs of the district. TEC §',\n",

Districts once had the opportunity to apply for a waiver to start the school calendar earlier, but because of advocacy and resistance from Texas tourism groups these waivers no longer exist. These groups argue that an earlier school start date is detrimental to the Texas Summer tourism business. In order to maximize the tourism business, the current law now prohibits schools from starting before the fourth Monday in August. Proposed Flexibility: NCCISD may begin school earlier in August than the fourth Monday. Rationale for Exemption The school calendar should reflect the values in the community it serves. Flexibility to start school earlier in August would allow NCCISD to balance the number of instructional days per semester, maximize instruction before standardized testing, and maximize professional development. An earlier school start time would allow our students who take dual credit classes from the local college to begin on the first day of the college semester.

Flexibility to begin earlier in the calendar year will enable the district to improve active learning by balancing the amount of instructional time in the semesters , which will allow teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after the winter break. In addition, by having the flexibility to start and end the school year earlier, students will be able to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. In addition to the start date, Overton ISD will also seek exemptions from the restriction on the number of early release days allowed. The flexibility to use the 75,600 minute requirement for academic instruction without a limit on the number of early release days will provide the district with more opportunities to provide quality professional development and time designated for Professional Learning Communities, academic alignment meetings, peer mentoring support, and general trainings as required by state statutes and TEA policies.

The current process allows no flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the community or the wishes of the local Board of Trustees who represent community interests in this matter. Proposed PISD students will start class no earlier than the 2nd Monday in August. Our primary goal is to create flexibility in our calendar which will be beneficial to all stakeholders. 4. Class Size Ratio Currently Kindergarten – 4th Grade classes are to be kept at a 22 student to 1 teacher ratio according to state law. When a class exceeds this limit, the district must complete a waiver with the Texas Education Agency. These waivers are never rejected by TEA. This is a bureaucratic step that serves no purpose. Along with the waiver, it is required that a letter is sent home to each parent in the section that exceeds the 22:1 ratio, informing them the waiver has been submitted. There are times when the classes are below the 22:1 ratio after the waiver process has been completed due to students moving out of the district. Proposed PISD has filed for waivers on a yearly basis because of our unpredicted growth. While we certainly believe that small class size plays a positive role in the classroom, this must be balanced with the logistics of the timing of adding staff, and the best teacher to student ratio that can be achieved given the total number of students. While our goal will be to maintain the 22:1 ratio, in the event the class size exceeds the 22:1 ratio for Kindergarten – 4th grade classes, a TEA waiver will not be necessary, but the superintendent will report to the Board of Trustees for approval. The board will be provided an update of class size numbers at the end of the 1st six week and at the end of the 4th six weeks. This exemption only allows PISD the local control over class size ratios, not a disregard for the intent of the ratio requirements. This plan also emphasizes the importance of flexible learning environments and student learning based upon student driven passions and needs. This grants flexibility in class size at all times-regrouping for success, small groups, large groups, etc. It also works to minimize paperwork requirements in order to free up time to place additional focus on student success.

Probationary Contracts Exemption from Statutory Citation: Texas Education Code (TEC) §21.102(b) Manner in which law inhibits Board Goals: TEC §21.102(b) states that a probationary contract may not exceed one year for a person who has been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight years preceding employment with the district. Due to the unique nature of Pettus ISD, including our processes and initiatives, this period of time may not be sufficient to properly evaluate the teacher’s instructional effectiveness in the classroom since teacher contract timelines demand that employment decisions must be made prior to the availability of end-of-year classroom and student performance data. Proposal: Upon exemption from Texas Education Code (TEC) §21.102(b), all new, experienced contract certified employees to Pettus ISD subject to TEC Chapter 21, will be subject to up to a two year probationary period set out in TEC §21.102(c), in order to allow more time for the district to fairly and thoroughly assess an employee’s performance. Partial years will not count toward the full year requirement. The term of employment will be based on performance. Probationary contracts for first-year teachers will remain at up to a three-year probationary period with term of employment based on performance. With the challenges that our district faces, this allows those teachers more time to develop professionally before a long-term decision on their employment is made. 4.

The move will better align teacher contracts to the 75,600 minutes of instruction requirements for our students. The teachers will fulfill the required 75,600 minutes of instruction and any additional professional development days as determined locally by the PISD Board of Trustees. This strategy will provide opportunities for teachers to seek out beneficial content area staff development during summer months and may improve teacher morale.

For many years, this was the rule. However, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. This law restricts flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community.

       " '|25.0811 specifies that a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. Rationale of Exemption The restriction of a specific start date prohibits the creation of a balanced and student-centered calendar. This exemption would allow the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students, the school, and the community. Benefits of Exemption Flexibility would have the following advantages: ● A better balance between instructional days during each semester. Currently and in the past, there has been upward of a fifteen day instructional difference between the Fall and Spring semesters. ● More instructional days in advance of standardized assessments, such as Advanced Placement, STAAR and EOC exams. ● Additional instructional time after the last official day of school to provide accelerated instruction for students retaking a STAAR or EOC exam over the summer. ● More flexibility to offer a full array of dual credit courses and better serve students, thus working more collaboratively with our institutions of higher education. ● More balanced distribution of instructional time for one-semester coursework, as students who currently take a one-semester course in the fall have fewer instructional days to master course content than students who take the same one-semester course in the spring. 1 Implementation Guidance When planning the student and staff calendars, the District shall ensure the following: ● Changes to the student and staff calendars specified in this proposal must not go into effect until the 2018-19 school year. ● Upon adoption of the Local Innovation Plan, the public must be notified that the school year may start earlier than the fourth Monday in August for the following school year. ● Winter Break should serve as the midpoint of the school year. ● Adjustments to the student and staff calendars must be budget-neutral. ● The start date for any school year will be limited to the month of August. However, the DAAC shall take staff, parent, student, and community survey data and other practical concerns into consideration during the development of the instructional calendar.

Proposed This flexibility of an earlier start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students and local community. Having the flexibility to establish an earlier start date will enable the District to balance the amount of instructional time available in each semester, providing classroom teachers the opportunity to deliver more equitable learning experiences for students in the fall and spring semesters. \\u200b \\u200bAdditional benefits are listed below: ● An improved balanced instructional calendar - Under the current law, the fall is generally shortened due the semester ending prior to the Winter/Christmas Break. In the District’s 2017-18 calendar, there are 73 days in the fall semester and 98 days in the spring semester. By adjusting the school start day in August, our semesters will become more balanced. ● Students participating in Dual Enrollment opportunities will follow a calendar more closely aligned to the local college calendar including the number of days in both the fall and spring semester. ● An early start date permits students an additional week or more of instruction prior to state assessments. ● Students will be afforded opportunities to enroll in summer college sessions with finalized official transcripts and staff will be able to attend summer school classes as well. This is a result of the spring semester ending in late May or very early June. ● Flexibility creates opportunities for District to pursue other calendar options for identified populations.

       " '|25.0811 FIRST DAY of INSTRUCTION (a) A school district may not begin instruction before the 4th Monday in August, unless the school operates year-round, or if district has more than 190,000 students: the days are financed by local funds, or the campus is under comprehensive reform, or the majority of the students at the campus(es) are educationally disadvantaged. Rationale for the Exemption: Restricting school start date to the 4th Monday in August operationally challenges Ponder ISD because the 75,600 instructional minutes must be calendared between the 4th Monday in August and generally the first week of June. Ponder ISD in collaboration with the local community should decide what is best for its students and staff in order to achieve goals outlined by the district. Flexibility of start date allows for a more targeted approach for academic excellence as well as opportunities for professional development. Local Guidelines: The district will have the flexibility to designate the first day of school each year. The calendar exemption does not affect the number of contract days for teachers, which will remain the same. PROBATIONARY CONTRACTS Texas Education Code: § 21.102(b). PROBATIONARY CONTRACTS (b) A probationary contract may not be for a term exceeding one school year. The probationary contract may be renewed for two additional one-year periods, for a maximum permissible probationary contract period of three school years, except that the probationary period may not exceed one year for a person who has been employed as a teacher in public education for at least five of the eight years preceding employment by the district. Rationale for the Exemption: The current system allows for one year on a probationary contract for a teacher that is new to our district but has taught five of the last eight years. This may not be a sufficient amount of time to truly evaluate whether or not the new employee will be a good fit for our district. Exemption from TEC',\n",

Locally-developed parameters guide committee members in their creation of a calendar that is responsive to the needs of students, teachers, families, and the community. TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin instruction for students before the fourth Monday in August. TEC 25.0812 states that a school district may not end instruction for students before May 15th. Beginning a school year on the 4th Monday in August, however, makes the calendar creation process highly restrictive and does not allow for meaningful discretion. This is compounded even further in years in which the 4th Monday in August falls late in the month. To allow for greater flexibility and responsiveness to student, teacher, family, and community needs in the calendar development process, Port Arthur ISD will be exempt from TEC 25.0811 and TEC 25.0812. Instead, Port Arthur ISD will have the flexibility to begin the school year earlier than the 4th Monday in August and end the school year earlier, as feasible. Adjustments to the first and/or last day of school will provide more days of uninterrupted instructional time through an earlier start and in preparation for end of year assessments, allow the district to better balance instructional days during the first and second semester; allow the district to strategically embed professional learning days and preparation days; allow greater flexibility in scheduling holidays; better align the start date for district courses with university start dates, in support of co-enrollment students; and perhaps allow us to better attract families who seek a non-traditional school calendar.

       " '|25.0811 Uniform School Start Date A school district must delay the beginning of instruction for students for a school year until the fourth Monday in August unless the district operates a year-round system. A district may not receive a waiver for this requirement. Proposed innovation strategies: The flexibility of start date allows the district to determine locally what best meets the needs of the students and local community. By beginning school before the fourth Monday in August, we will be able to: ❏ Provide consistency in the amount of days from the fall semester to the spring semester. The 2016-2017 school calendar has semesters of drastically different lengths, with 78 days in the fall and 94 days in the spring. This becomes problematic for teachers and students. ❏ Allow professional development and collaboration among teachers and staff to be embedded in the school year calendar. ❏ Provide flexibility for summer school options, internships, and professional certification experiences for students. ❏ Provide additional instructional days to prepare for state tests. ❏ Align with Advanced Placement and Dual Credit semester requirements. Local Guidelines: On an annual basis, the district will determine when each school year will begin. SUMMARY Upon approval from the Board of Trustees, the DOI Committee created this Local Innovation Plan based on the needs of students and the local community. The proposed exemptions will be monitored by staff, the DOI committee, and the Board of Trustees by using student performance data.

       " '|25.0811: A school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. (Board Policy Ref: EB (Legal) School Year) B. DIP References: Goal 1, Goal 3, and Goal 4. C. Challenges/Obstacles: The increasingly later start date for instruction has presented numerous challenges and obstacles to District academic operations. Fall and spring semesters are significantly unequal in length; opportunities for collaborative teacher planning and preparation time are reduced, the last day of instruction gets pushed farther into June which negatively affects summer programming and some students and staff who wish to attend universities and colleges in the summer miss the first days of college classes. In the past, to attempt to balance the semesters due to a late start date, RISD ended the first semester after the winter break for two consecutive years. This strategy created hardships for students who were required to work on significant projects during the holidays. The break from instruction near the end of the semester also made it more difficult for students to prepare for semester examinations. The unequal semesters also negatively affects one semester classes such as health, AP Psychology, Professional Communications, Economics, etc. because the same curriculum still must be taught in fewer instructional days. The shortened instructional period makes it more difficult for students to master the concepts and increases out of school assignments. Each year, consistent with its local policy, RISD seeks input from stakeholders about the academic calendar. Stakeholder input following the change in the end of the fall semester overwhelmingly communicated the desire to end the fall 7 semester before the holiday break even if it resulted in unbalanced semesters. The longstanding and consistent input that the District has received from internal and external stakeholders since that time is that they desire to (i) complete the fall semester before the winter break, (ii) have the last day of instruction fall in the last week of May, (iii) retain a Fair Day holiday in October, and (iv) have the week of Thanksgiving as a fall break. In addition, teachers and campus administrators value strategically placed professional development days in each semester to assist campuses in analyzing student performance and planning. The late school start date interferes with developing an academic calendar that meets stakeholder desires as well as implementing best practices of balancing the fall and spring semesters, negatively affects student learning, causes low staff morale in the spring due to a later ending date, and reduces teacher preparation time. D. Proposed Innovation/Benefits: RISD will no longer be required to delay the start of school to the fourth Friday in August as currently required by TEC § 25.0811. Upon implementation of the DOI Plan, the District will determine an appropriate start date annually that does not occur before the second Monday in August. RISD will continue to consider stakeholder input as required by Board policy EB (Local) in its determination of the first day of instruction. A more reasonable school start date will provide RISD flexibility to incorporate stakeholder input into its calendar process, increase stakeholder satisfaction, allow for a more balanced academic calendar, provide more opportunities for collaborative teacher planning and preparation time and professional development throughout the year at times best suited to instructional needs, and generally improve the overall efficient operations of the District. The maintenance of good professional development is directly related to student success. E. Note: Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs. RISD will continue to comply with the UIL calendar for commencement of summer practices. II. Length of Instructional Day A. Statutory Exemption(s): Texas Education Code §|25.0811.

This enables us to personalize learning, increase college and career readiness, balance the amount of instructional time per semester, and provide more flexible professional development opportunities for our staff. In addition, this change will help enable students to enroll in college courses that start in early June, avoiding a hurdle that otherwise might hinder students’ college and career readiness. Removing the uniform start date would also allow RISD to start classes on a Wednesday or Thursday easing the transition to schooling for students entering Pre-K/Kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and high school.

       " '|25.0811: Requires that a school district may not begin instruction for students for a school year before the fourth Monday in August. Innovation Plan for Rogers ISD: • The state requires that school districts not begin instruction for students for a school year prior to the fourth Monday in August. This creates challenges, including significant disparities in the number of instructional days provided in each of the two school year semesters as well as potential challenges related to the effective pacing of instruction within the school calendar. This exemption will provide the opportunity to develop a school calendar that promotes improved balance in the number of instructional days each semester in order to positively impact the academic performance and outcomes of students. Implementation Considerations: Rogers ISD conducted a calendar survey of students, parents, community, and staff members to determine which calendar option most fit the desires of our stakeholders. Overwhelmingly, an earlier start date was the desired calendar for our constituents.

       " '|25.0811) Currently Students may not begin school before the 4th Monday of August. For many years this has been the rule, however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier. The Texas tourism group lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting the tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. However, for the past 4 years, Roscoe Collegiate ISD has had a special waiver granted as an Early College to begin the 2nd Monday in August to better align with out Community College Partner Calendar. In June of 2015, TEA Commissioner Michael Williams advised me that there would no longer be an Early College waiver granted and advised me to seek that flexibility through the District of Innovation designation. Proposed To allow for a calendar that fits the local needs of our community, Roscoe Collegiate ISD will continue to begin school on the 2nd Monday in August to better achieve student outcomes consistent with Early College/STEM Academy expectations. a. Students will begin school on the 2nd Monday in August. b. Teachers will begin in-\\xad‐service activities on the 1st Monday in August. c. This will allow an equal number of days in each semester, provide student orientation time prior to the start of the college semester, eliminate inefficient time after the conclusion of the college semester, and allow break time prior to the start of summer school for all students. d.

       " '|25.0811 First Day of Instruction (a) A school district may not begin instruction before the 4th Monday in August, unless the school operates year-round, or if district has more than 190,000 students: the days are financed by local funds, or the campus is under comprehensive reform, or the majority of the students at the campus(es) are educationally disadvantaged. Rationale for the Exemption: Restricting school start date to the 4th Monday in August operationally challenges RLISD because the 75,600 instructional minutes must be calendared between the 4th Monday in August and generally May 28. Flexibility to the start date would allow the district to address the following issues caused by the current calendar constraints: 1. Increased student regression due to longer summer break. 2. Lack of flexibility to schedule student breaks or other options during the school year. 3. Condensed employee work schedules limiting flexibility to schedule holidays, personal days and professional development days impacting employee work / life balance. 4. Increased teacher absences and related substitute teacher expense. 5. A lack of true choice for the Calendar Committee in development of the school calendar. 6. The flexibility will allow students who are in need of retest opportunities on state testing, additional instructional days prior to the retest opportunities.

This resolution initiated the process of designation as a District of Innovation in order to increase local control over District operations and to support innovation and local initiatives to improve educational outcomes for the benefit of students and the community. On February 13, 2017, the board held a public meeting and made the determination to pursue the district of Innovation designation for the sole purpose of exemption from TEC §25.0811 First Day of Instruction. At that time, the Board appointed the District Education Improvement Council (DEIC) as the Local Innovation Committee representing the District’s various stakeholders including teachers, principals, parents, community members and administrators. The purpose of the Local Innovation Committee is to develop a local innovation plan for exemption from TEC§25.0811 First Day of Instruction only. On February 14, 2017 and March 6, 2017 the Local Innovation Committee met to draft the Local Innovation Plan (“Plan”). The Committee sought and considered input for the plan through a public meeting held on March 6, 2017 as well as through input from members reaching out to constituents throughout the planning process.

       " '|25.0811 (First Day of Instruction) SAISD seeks an exemption from the implementation of 25.0811 so as to obtain flexibility, should campuses or the District as a whole seek it, to begin instruction for students before the fourth (4th) Monday in August. Texas has debated the school start date for three decades beginning in 1984 when the Legislature established September 1 as the uniform start date. In 1991, the Legislature repealed the uniform start date but reinstated it in 2001. In 2004, the Legislature amended the uniform start date to its current form. The argument has been that with schools starting earlier and earlier students and teachers are no longer getting a true summer break; however, Districts such as SAISD have seen that there is significant student regression over the summer and to truly have continuous learning and maximize student performance, districts should have the flexibility to begin school earlier than the 4th Monday in August. Most of the charters within the district’s boundaries start two to three weeks earlier than SAISD. By moving up the start of the school year, the fall semester can be completed before Winter Break. Therefore, the first few weeks of January are not taken up by review and testing. That arrangement would benefit teachers and students. II. Given Assumptions Regarding Compensation and Consensus-Building a. Compensation The District of Innovation status will have no effect on the District’s per campus funding allocations. Campuses are expected to develop their innovation plans in a cost-effective manner. New personnel allocations will not be provided to campuses, however, the District will offer supplemental pay or stipends to teachers at campuses requesting additional planning time or extended school days. Supplemental pay of $25 per hour will be provided to teachers who are required to work beyond their normal work days for planning, professional development, and other activities where students are not present. Annual stipends of up to $3,500 will be provided to teachers at campuses with extended school days, where teachers are required to provide additional instruction to students on a daily basis. b. Consensus-Building Inclusion of our teachers and their feedback is critical to the success of the campus plans. The principal should consider including representatives from multiple stakeholder groups to develop the plan. If the plan includes any of the three “district of innovation designations” (class size, potentially increasing the instructional day and calendar year), teachers directly affected by the proposed plan will be required to participate in a blind vote. (Eighty percent of the affected teachers must approve the recommended change(s).) SAISD’s Future with the District of Innovation Designation As campuses develop their future plans, some freedoms might be beneficial to all campuses and could be considered for inclusion in future revisions of the district’s innovation plan while others may be specific to individual campuses.

Flexibility to the start date would allow the district to address issues caused by the current calendar constraints: • Lack of flexibility to schedule student breaks or other options during the school year. • Condensed employee work schedules limiting flexibility to schedule holidays, personal days and professional development days impacting employee work / life balance. • Increased teacher absences and related substitute teacher expense. • A lack of true choice for the District Leadership Team in development of the school calendar.

       " '|25.0811 and §25.0812 EB(LEGAL) Innovation: TEC Ch. 12A.003(b)(1)(B) Modifications to the school day or year The current laws prohibit the district from starting school before the third Monday of August and ending before May 15th, forcing the District into a calendar that has minimal opportunity for teacher professional development and provides negligible time for summer school/STAAR intervention before STARR testing in the summer. Having the flexibility to start and end school as needed will minimize the negative impacts the District sees in these areas. Starting early will allow for creative scheduling that allows for more intentional teacher professional development throughout the school year, and also allows students to have a schedule that is more conducive to their learning. Rationale: These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. The flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable the district to develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in Santa Fe ISD. An earlier start date allows a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to mandatory testing, and a school end date prior to June. By ending earlier, Santa Fe ISD can support students who need remediation, as well as students who are entering college or post-secondary programs. An earlier school start date allows these students to register for summer classes and attend new student orientation meetings without missing instructional time.

       " '|25.0811 (EB LEGAL) First Day of Instruction- States that a School District may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. i. Innovation Strategy 1. Flexible Calendar – Santa Gertrudis ISD will begin instruction no earlier than the first week of August in an effort to create greater flexibility in the school calendar. Although small rural-and military related transitions are somewhat unpredictable, there is a pattern of transitions that occur in alignment with winter break. Due to this pattern of transitions, it has been our practice, based on community input, to complete first-semester course offerings prior to the beginning of winter break. This practice allows military-connected and small rural students a concurrent transition. This practice also supports Santa Gertrudis ISD’s ability to reduce stressors related to grades and course completion, a strong contribution to positive social–emotional growth. 2. Balanced Semesters – In an effort to support student ability to complete course work prior to transitions that occur in conjunction with winter break, the fall semester has significantly fewer days than the spring semester. Flexible start dates allow the District to ensure that fall semester courses have the same opportunity to provide curricular depth and complexity as provided in the spring semester. 3. Participation in College Courses – By having flexibility in the start and end of the school year, students will be able to enroll in college courses that may start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. There is also a greater opportunity for students to take dual credit courses that match a college academic calendar: which, includes the period of intersession. ii. Local Guidelines: 1. The District Calendar Committee will receive staff and community input to build the school calendar. 2. The draft calendar will be posted for additional feedback. 3. The District Calendar Committee will consider feedback and recommend a school calendar for Board approval. 4. The recommended school calendar is subject to Board approval. c. §',\n",

Innovation Strategy: The flexibility of the start and end dates allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the need of the students, the school, and the community. In addition, this flexibility allows the district to better align its starting date to accommodate the start date of colleges for which the district partners for dual credit courses. Another benefit of exempting this restriction is it allows the school to look at starting classes as a short week which can ease the transition for students entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school. Additionally, the ability to change the school start date can also help to better balance the amount of days in each semester. This also allows for the possibility of an earlier release prior to May 15th once the 75,600 instructional minute requirement and all testing have been completed. 2.

This law was supported by Texas tourism groups who lobbied to have a late August school start date because they believed it would promote the Texas tourism business. However, the impact of this law has been having fewer school holidays during the school year and/or a later ending date in June which also limits Texas tourism at other times during the year. This creates challenges, including significant disparities in the number of instructional days provided in each of the two school year semesters or the need to end the first school semester after the Christmas break. Proposed Flexibility: The flexibility of school start date allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of the students, parents, and faculty. Flexibility to start earlier in August would help our students with more balanced days of instructional time in the semesters that would support semester courses. Flexibility will further facilitate finishing the first school semester before the Christmas break. In addition, flexibility in the start and end of the school year allows students to enroll in college courses that begin in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness.

Students may begin earlier than the fourth Monday of August. As well, it allows the SISD to schedule more timely and meaningful staff developments throughout the year. Rationale Flexibility to begin instruction earlier in the calendar year will enable the SISD to be more responsive to teaching and learning by balancing the amount of instructional time between the first and second semesters. Balancing instructional days before and after winter break allows teachers to better pace the delivery of instruction within an academic school year. Once a start date is determined, professional development days can be embedded in a timely manner that allows for more immediate implementation. Action Steps 1. DEIC subcommittee reviews other area district calendars as well as local college calendar and discusses professional development day options, historical holiday preferences, and flexibility. 2. DEIC subcommittee drafts multiple calendar options. 3. Potential draft calendars are shared with all DEIC committee members for input and revisions. 4. Campus improvement teams share the calendar options with staff and reach consensus on the calendar of choice for that campus. 5. Calendars are posted online for community and staff voting. 6. DEIC committee members reach consensus for final calendar recommendation that best meets the needs of students, families, and SISD staff. 7. Final calendar choice is recommended to superintendent to be presented to the Board of Trustees. Minimum Attendance for Class Credit or Final Grade (TEC §',\n",

The District anticipates starting school during the month of August and concluding the school year in May. The primary advantages of this change will be to: · Balance the days of instruction in the six-week grading periods and semesters · Allow for the first semester to conclude prior to the holiday break · Afford greater flexibility in calendar options · Utilize more instructional time prior to the state assessments given in early May · Allow calendar to be more efficient following May STAAR/EOC assessments · Align the district’s calendar with the area junior college(s) in order to accommodate Spring Creek High School students. This will also allow time to provide student orientation time prior to the start of the college semester, eliminate inefficient time after the conclusion of the college semester, and allow break time prior to the start of summer school for all students. · Align curriculum of dual credit courses through area junior college(s) Goal(s): · Alignment of academic calendar with the needs of the district, students, parents, community members and other cooperating partners CHAPTER 25 - ADMISSION, TRANSFER, ATTENDANCE MINIMUM MINUTES OF INSTRUCTION/LENGTH OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAY · Minimum Minutes of Instruction/Length of Instructional Day Texas Education Code TEC §',\n",

For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to begin school earlier. Local Guidelines and Innovation Strategies: The waiver process was eliminated several years ago, mandating that all schools begin school no earlier than the fourth Monday of August, with no exceptions. This requirement inhibits the District’s flexibility to develop a calendar that best meets students’, staff, and community needs. Research has found that a catalyst to accelerating student learning and improving teacher practice is allowing for structured time for educators to prepare, lesson plan, and receive professional development. Other benefits of this flexibility include having balanced semesters that allow for finals prior to the Christmas break and for the completion of the K-12 school year that allows high school students the ability to attend summer college courses. Local Guidelines and Innovation Strategies: The school calendar will be designed so that the semesters are balanced, with the first semester ending at Christmas break. The school calendar will allow for timely and meaningful staff development. Before the school year begins, teachers will have ample professional development and teacher preparation and planning time. The calendar will provide for designated time after the first quarter for professional development and possible flex time to make up for professional development attended during the summer months and /or Saturday professional development.

       " '|25.0811, TEC 25.0812 Manner in which statute inhibits the goals of plan: TEC 25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. TEC 25.0812 states that a school district may not schedule the last day of school before May 15. Purpose and Proposal of Innovative Strategies: These laws restrict the flexibility in the development of the annual calendar to fit the needs of the students, the school district, and the community. The flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable SISD to develop a calendar that will meet the needs of all students in SISD by balancing the number of days in 5 each semester. This will allow teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after winter break and allow for more instruction time before the state mandated assessments and re- testing. Professional development can be provided during the academic year on days when students are not present, reducing the usage of substitute personnel, and allowing personnel to collaborate and review data across grade levels to better improve student outcomes. Further, this exemption will provide relief at the secondary level for students who are enrolled in dual credit courses. The earlier start and end dates will allow alignment with the calendars of local colleges and universities we partner with. Additionally, upon graduation, students and teachers will be able to register and attend the first summer sessions at institutions of higher learning. Upon implementation of the DOI Plan, the district will determine an appropriate start date annually that does not occur before the third Monday in August for students, and an appropriate end date that does not exceed the last day of May (unless the first administration of state assessments should be scheduled on that day). NOTE: Changing the first day of instruction does not alter the University Interscholastic League (UIL) restrictions for the first day of practice for athletic and fine arts programs. Sweetwater ISD will continue to comply with the UIL calendar for summer practices and will not move summer practices earlier, despite potentially moving up the start date of school. 2.

       " '|25.0811, §25.0812) Legal school policy and statute currently prevents school from beginning the school year prior to the 4 th Monday in August. The last day of school, addressed in Section 25.0812 of the Education Code, specifies that the last day of school may not occur before May 15. Teacher Contract Days (DCB LEGAL, DBC LOCAL) (TEC§21.401) Chapter 21 of the TEC defines a teacher contract as a ten month contract equivalent to 187 days. Innovative Plan (TISD Values Addressed: Continuous Improvement, student-centered learning) The plan would allow the district the opportunity to balance the fall and spring semesters by beginning the school year earlier, if the district calendar selection committee so desired. In addition, the district could build in staff development days throughout the school year based on data-determined needs for the individual campuses and district as a whole, rather than simply using the majority of staff development days prior to the beginning of the school year so that teachers reached 10 additional work days beyond the 177 instructional work days the district has typically had in place in order to meet the 187 day teacher contract requirement. Lastly, if the district adopts a calendar that meets the minimum instructional minute requirements yet is under 175 instructional days, the district is not obligated to fill in teacher work days just to meet the 187 teacher contract day total. These changes would provide the district with opportunities to seek continual improvement (a core district value) by providing its employees with more strategically targeted professional development because it would occur during the year when the district and campuses have timelier student data to work with as it seeks to improve student performance. The flexibility with the district’s end date, in combination with an earlier start date, would allow the district to maximize instructional time prior to the May STAAR and EOC testing dates, thereby, reducing the amount of instructional time after state STAAR testing time.

TISD will maximize opportunities for students to be college and career ready. ● TISD will continue to improve academic performance to meet or exceed STARR state accountability standards. Rationale TEC §25.0811 states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday of August. For many years this was the rule; however, districts had the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier, even as early as the 2nd Monday in August. The flexibility to set the start and end date of school allows the district to determine locally, on an annual basis, what best meets the needs of our students and community. An earlier start date allows teachers additional planning and preparation time, a better balance between semesters, more instructional days prior to AP exams, college readiness exams, mandatory state assessments, and a school end date prior to June. This will allow our students the opportunity to enroll in college courses that start in early June, thereby increasing college and career readiness. In addition, removing the constraints of this statute will allow TISD the opportunity to provide more frequent breaks for students/staff and flexible professional development for teachers. Parameters 1. The District, through input from the Campus Leadership Team (CLT), Campus Educational Improvement Committee (CEIC), and DEIC, shall determine locally, on an annual basis, the upcoming school calendar. 2.

These statute requirements do not take into consideration the needs for the students within specific communities. Rationale: Terrell County ISD seeks local control over the start and end dates of a school year. This provides TCISD with the flexibility needed to address the instructional needs of the students while addressing the professional development needs of the district staff. This flexibility would help balance the days of instruction in each semester and align the district’s calendar with Midland College and/or the University of Texas of the Permian Basin for dual credit courses. This calendar flexibility would work in conjunction with the new instructional minutes rather than instructional day requirements.

For many years prior this was the rule; however, districts did have the option of applying for a waiver to start earlier. The vast majority of districts applied for the state waiver and began the 3rd Monday, some even going as early as the 2nd Monday in August. Several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday in August, with no exceptions. Recent legislation prevents the last day of school prior to May 15. Terrell ISD, however, will provide a calendar that addresses student instruction and focused professional development plan in conjunction with the new instructional minutes rather than instructional days required. Local control of the instructional calendar affords the District the flexibility to end the school year prior to May 15, should the district deem it necessary and appropriate. Innovation Plan: To allow for a school calendar that fits the local needs of our community, emphasizes active learning, college & career readiness, and social and emotional needs of students, Terrell ISD will: a. Provide flexibility to begin instruction earlier and develop a school calendar that meets the needs of the district. a) This will enable Terrell ISD to improve active learning by balancing the amount of instructional time in each semester. b) This will allow teachers to better pace and deliver instruction before and after the winter break. c) This will promote social and emotional learning and allow students transitioning from kindergarten to first grade, from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school to receive support to enable them to adjust to their new campus environments. b.

       " '|25.0811 EB(LEGAL) Rationale: Texas Education Code states that a school district may not begin student instruction before the 4th Monday in August. This forces the district into a calendar that has minimal opportunity for teacher professional development, causes shortened grading periods when the first semester ends in December, and provides negligible time for summer school before state mandated assessment re-takes in the summer. Innovation: To best serve the students in Texas City ISD, we would like the option of starting before the 4th Monday of August.

Length of School Day (EC Legal) (Ed. Code 25.082) Currently State law currently requires that all school days must be 420 minutes long each day in order to count for ADA calculations and funding purposes, and to accumulate instructional minutes towards the 75,600 minutes required annually. Proposed Exempting from the 420-minute day requirement would allow Thorndale ISD the flexibility needed to alter the school day schedule whenever it was locally determined as necessary or beneficial to the district and its stakeholders. Exempting completely from the 420- minute requirement would give the district a significant amount of local control over scheduling without the fear of diminishing state funding or losing credit for instructional time that might cause the district to fall out of compliance with annual minute requirements. 3 3.

The vast majority of districts applied for the waiver and would begin the 3rd Monday, some even going as early as the 2nd Monday. Currently The Texas tourism groups lobbied to have this stopped because they believed it was hurting their tourism business. Therefore, several years ago the legislature took away all waivers and dictated that districts may not begin until the 4th Monday, with no exceptions. To allow for a calendar that fits the local needs of our community, we would like to consider moving the mandatory start date back one week which would better benefit our students. Proposed a.

Proposed: Through the district of innovation investigation process, our community has communicated a desire to have flexibility in deciding when the school year begins. By having a flexible start date, students will experience more balanced semesters, alignment with higher education entities, and varied options for valuable time away from school to support a community and family focus. In addition, the committee will explore the benefits of a shortened transition into the school year to allow students, families and staff to best prepare for the year ahead. Seven Hour School Day §25.082 Current: Texas Education Code requires that a school day shall be at least seven hours each day, including intermissions and recesses. Proposed: WISD strategic planning committee discovered local needs for timely professional development that is provided throughout the year, rather than loaded at the beginning and end of the academic calendar. Through staff and community feedback, this is found to be an unfavorable method of training, when used as the sole method of delivery, with a reduced impact on instruction and student achievement. In addition, the district seeks local control to adjust the length of the school day to accommodate additional professional development and innovative learning opportunities not accomplished within a traditional seven hour school day.

Rationale: The flexibility of start date will allow the district to determine on an annual basis what best meets the needs of the students and local community. Having the flexible start date will allow the district to balance the amount of instructional time in each semester, which will improve the ability to implement special programs and nontraditional school models. It will also support our college and career readiness efforts by aligning with local college calendars. Ending the school year earlier will create a more favorable schedule for summer enrichment to ease documented summer learning loss. A flexible start will also allow the district to go back to the tradition of starting the school year with a short week, which has previously proven to foster a smoother, less tiring transition back to the school year. 7 | P a g e Campus Behavior Coordinator Requirement: Senate Bill 107 requires via Texas Education Code §',\n",

Proposal: These laws restrict flexibility in the design of annual calendars to fit the needs of the school district and community. The flexibility to begin instruction earlier in August will enable the district to develop a calendar that best meets the needs of the students in WPISD.
